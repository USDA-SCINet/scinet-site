  - title: "CLC Workbench and Server upgraded"
    date: 2025-02-18
    excerpt: "CLC Workbench and Server, a bioinformatics application available on the Ceres cluster's Open OnDemand interface, has been upgraded to version 25."
  - title: "New Animal Behavior AI Working Group"
    date: 2025-02-04
    excerpt: "This SCINet working group aims to explore the potential benefits of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in animal behavior research. To learn more about the working group, please [see the working group description here](/research/working-groups/behavior)."
  - title: "LincPass login for café machines"
    date: 2025-01-15
    excerpt: "The SCINet café machines offer high-speed data transfer capabilities to and from SCINet’s supercomputers and data storage infrastructure. These machines have been updated to support streamlined logins with a LincPass."
  - title: "Streamlined web-based login"
    date: 2025-01-28
    excerpt: "SCINet users will no longer see the SCINet login page that asks for a username and password when they access SCINet systems. Instead, SCINet logins immediately redirect to USDA’s eAuthentication (eAuth) site, at which point they continue to authenticate as usual using either their LincPass/AltLinc card or Login.gov credentials."
  - title: "AlphaFold 3 Available on SCINet Clusters"
    date: 2025-01-28
    excerpt: "The AlphaFold 3 software, databases, and model weights are now available on both Ceres and Atlas! To learn more about how to use AlphaFold 3 on SCINet clusters, please [see instructions here](/guides/application/alphafold3)."
  - title: "Simplified Globus login"
    date: 2024-12-11
    excerpt: "SCINet users can now log in to Globus using their SCINet accounts like any other web-based SCINet access (previously, logging in to Globus required ORCiD credentials). When logging into Globus.org, you can select 'SCINet - ARS/USDA' in the existing organizational login dropdown menu."
  - title: "New Breeding AI and ML Working Group"
    date: 2024-10-31
    excerpt: "The focus of this group is to create a space where researchers working on addressing problems in breeding using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods can exchange knowledge and build community support. To learn more about the working group, please [see the working group description here](/research/working-groups/breeding)."
  - title: "Expanded memory in A100 GPU nodes"
    date: 2024-10-30
    excerpt: "All five A100 GPU nodes on Atlas have had their available memory doubled from 1TB to 2TB. This improvement allows for more efficient use of the GPUs and helps support larger input datasets."
  - title: "Atlas OOD terminal"
    date: 2024-07-02
    excerpt: "When in [Open OnDemand on Atlas](https://atlas-ood.hpc.msstate.edu/), the terminal created by clicking on *Clusters* > *Atlas Shell Access* no longer prompts users to re-authenticate."
  - title: "SCINet Login Updates"
    date: 2024-06-26
    excerpt: "Legacy authentication using SCINet usernames, passwords, and authentication codes is no longer supported. Access to SCINet is now limited to authentication with a LincPass or a Login.gov account, with the exception of some sponsored accounts still using YubiKey devices. These accounts will be transitioned to Login.gov over the next few months. See detailed instructions on our [Logging Into SCINet Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/access)."
  - title: "Ceres OS upgraded"
    date: 2024-06-26
    excerpt: "The Linux distribution on Ceres has been changed from AlmaLinux to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.2. This should not cause complications with previously installed software or workflows."
  - title: "SCINet Login Updates"
    date: 2024-06-17
    excerpt: "Getting collaborators set up with sponsored SCINet accounts is now much quicker because non-LincPass holders can use Login.gov credentials. We are no longer relying on the physical devices, YubiKeys, that had to be mailed to such users. See detailed instructions on our [Logging Into SCINet Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/access)."
  - title: "Home directory quota increase"
    date: 2023-12-05
    excerpt: "Users can now have up to 15 GB of files in their home directories."
  - title: "New Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) nodes on Atlas"
    date: 2023-08-29
    excerpt: "Five new nodes on Atlas with a total of 40 NVIDIA A100 GPUs are now available. This drastically increases SCINet's GPU computing capacity and offers SCINet users access to state-of-the-art GPU technology for running AI and deep learning workflows, large-scale data analyses, and other computationally intensive tasks."
  - title: "Scheduling recurring jobs on Ceres and Atlas"
    date: 2023-04-10
    excerpt: "All SCINet users now have access to Slurm's \"scrontab\" feature, which makes it possible to schedule jobs that automatically run on a recurring basis."
  - title: "Atlas nodes have internet access"
    date: 2022-12-07
    excerpt: "All nodes on Atlas can now access resources on the Internet, which drastically simplifies many scientific computing workflows. For example, it is now possible to update software packages or access external data resources from any node on the system."
  - title: "New SCINet website launched"
    date: 2022-12-01
    excerpt: "The redesigned site includes a consolidated event calendar, improved user guide navigation, and a more informative landing page."
