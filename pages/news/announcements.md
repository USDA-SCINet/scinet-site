  - title: "SCINet Log In Updates"
    date: 2024-06-17
    excerpt: "Getting collaborators set up with sponsored SCINet accounts is now much quicker as non-LincPass holders can use Login.gov credentials. We are no longer relying on the physical devices, YubiKeys, that had to be mailed to such users.  
      
    See detailed instructions on our [Logging Into SCINet Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/access)."
