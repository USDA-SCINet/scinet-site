Below are instructions for how to make a request for a SCINet project, new software, or AWS resources.

## Project request
---

SCINet projects provide a structured way for ARS researchers to request storage space, work with collaborators, and submit computational jobs on SCINet infrastructure. To learn more about SCINet projects, see the [SCINet Project Management guide](/guides/data/project-management). 

### To request a new SCINet project
When requesting a new project, you will be asked for details including:
* a project summary, 
* requested storage amounts, and
* other SCINet users who you want to have access to the project. 

To request a new project, please fill out the request form (eAuthentication required, non-ARS users should contact their sponsor):

[Request a Project](https://forms.office.com/g/wD9rYarVyn){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  .usa-button .usa-button-big }

**Please note:** Requests for new SCINet projects must be submitted by the project’s Principal Investigator (PI), who must be a full-time ARS employee.

### To modify an existing SCINet project
To modify an existing SCINet project (e.g., adding a new member), the project's PI or manager should send an email to the SCINet Virtual Research Support Core (VRSC) [scinet_vrsc@usda.gov](mailto:scinet_vrsc@usda.gov?subject=modify%20project%20allocation) that includes:
* the name of the project directory (/project/\<projectname>/) and 
* the requested changes.


### To request a quota increase for an existing SCINet project
When requesting a project quota increase on Ceres or Atlas, you will be asked to briefly explain why using `/90daydata` and/or permanent storage on Juno does not cover your storage needs.  

To request a project quota increase for storage on Ceres, Atlas and/or Juno, please have the project PI or manager fill out the following request form (eAuthentication required, non-ARS users should contact their sponsor):

[Request a Project Quota Increase](https://forms.office.com/g/ntnKBzJiKx){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  .usa-button .usa-button-big }

## Globus guest collection request
---
Globus guest collections allow SCINet project owners to share a subdirectory in their project space with external collaborators who do not have SCINet accounts. The subdirectory is shared using Globus (see the [Globus guide](/guides/data/transfer/globus) for more details on using Globus). When requesting a guest collection, you will be asked for details including:  
  *	a summary of why a Globus guest collection is critical for your project,
  *	the subdirectory you would like to share, and
  *	with whom the subdirectory will be shared.

If you are working with a limited number of external collaborators and they need to be able to directly contribute to your research project, consider requesting sponsored SCINet accounts for them instead. To request a guest collection, please fill out the request form (eAuthentication required):

[Request Globus guest collection](https://forms.office.com/g/4auZYdvkrH){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  .usa-button .usa-button-big }

## Software request
---
### Before submitting a software request, please do the following:

1. Make sure the software isn't already available as a module by checking the lists of module software on the [Preinstalled Software List]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/software/preinstalled) page.

   If you only need a different version of a software package that is already installed on Ceres, please email [scinet_vrsc@usda.gov](mailto:scinet_vrsc@usda.gov?subject=software%20request%20-%20add%20different%20version).

2. Consider whether you should install the software yourself in your home or project directory - see the [Preinstalled Software List]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/software/preinstalled) for more details.

   You may want to use Conda for package, dependency, and environment management - see this [guide about how to use conda on SCINet]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/software/conda).

   If you're not sure whether you should install software yourself or if you need help, email [scinet_vrsc@usda.gov](mailto:scinet_vrsc@usda.gov?subject=help%20with%20software). Software that will be useful to many SCINet users should be installed as a module by the VRSC.


### How to send a software request
If you've completed the steps above and need new software installed as a module, use the software request form (eAuthentication required, non-ARS users should contact their sponsor):

[Software Request Form](https://apps.gov.powerapps.us/play/e/a3bf43b2-009c-43c2-9c4f-bcb2d87972fb/a/5b3265ab-3a98-4405-8557-01c1342690f7){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  .usa-button .usa-button-big }

**Please note:** Installing new, system-wide software on SCINet's clusters requires an agency-level security review and takes a few weeks. Requests to install proprietary software often require reviewing license terms and costs and typically take longer than for open-source software.


## AWS request
---
SCINet can provide access to AWS resources to SCINet users with suitable workloads. A limited amount of funding is available annually. _SCINet AWS funding is intended only for research projects that require cloud-based computational resources._ Interested SCINet users must submit a SCINet AWS Project Request to be considered for AWS funding.

### To add/modify AWS resources for an existing SCINet project 
Send an email that includes:
* the name of the project directory (/project/\<projectname>/) and 
* the requested changes

to the SCINet Virtual Research Support Core [scinet_vrsc@usda.gov](mailto:scinet_vrsc@usda.gov?subject=add%20AWS%20to%20SCINet%20project). 

This includes requests for additional funding.


### To request a new SCINet-funded AWS project 
Fill out an application form (eAuthentication required, non-ARS users should contact their sponsor):

[Request AWS Project](https://usda-scinet.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/4/group/13/create/63){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  .usa-button .usa-button-big }

Requests will be reviewed and projects funded based on criteria such as suitability for AWS versus other SCINet computing resources (e.g., Ceres, Atlas), resource requirements estimated from the project description, and availability of SCINet funding.
