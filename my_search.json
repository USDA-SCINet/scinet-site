If you are still able to login, do so and type “passwd” you will be prompted for your old password and asked for a new one.Read more about logging in to SCINet and changing your password here.Watch a video demonstration of changing your password here.[first.last@ceres-login ~] $ passwd Changing password for user first.last Current Password:  New password: Retype new password: passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully. If you have forgotten your login password, please email the VRSC: scinet_vrsc@usda.govWhat are the SCINet password requirements?   AT LEAST 14 characters long   Your last 24 passwords cannot be reused. How do I login to Ceres?Command line access is available via Secure Shell (SSH) and Virtual Private Network (VPN). For more info, see the Quick Start Guide.I took my onboarding a long time ago, how do I get a refresher course?Email the VRSC scinet_vrsc@usda.gov for a time and day. You can also read the Quick Start Guide or Ceres User Guide.SoftwareWhat software is available on SCINet?See the Ceres Preinstalled Software List for a list of available software. You can also login to Ceres or Atlas and issue the command “module avail” to see the same list of available software modules.How do I request software to be loaded onto Ceres?For new software requests, go to the Request Software page and follow the instructions which include 1) checking if the software is already installed, 2) considering whether to install software yourself, and 3) requesting new software to be installed as a module by the VRSC. Software requests sent to the VRSC require USDA Security Operations Center (SOC) review and approval which takes a few weeks.How do I install my own software programs?You may install your own software in your own directories, however, we strongly encourage users to contact the VRSC team to ensure that their required tool(s) might not be better distributed as a shared package within the official software modules tree.The popular R, Perl and Python languages have many packages/modules available. Some of the programming-language-specific packages are installed on Ceres and are available with the r/perl/python_2/python_3 modules. See the list of installed packages on the Software Overview page or use “module avail” at the command line. To see more information on a specific module, issue the “module help  command. Also see the [Installing R/Python/Perl Packages guide](/guides/analysis/r-perl-python).Another resource for installing your own software programs is the Conda package manager. See the User-Installed Software on Ceres Using Conda guideExperienced command-line users can also install open-source software locally in their project. We recommend installing packages in the project directories since collaborators on the same project most probably would need the same packages. In addition, home quotas are much lower than project directories quotas.Alternatively, one can use Singularity to run software container images (including Docker images). For more information, see the Singularity on Ceres guide.How do I compile software?Ceres has development libraries available on all nodes. There is a system version of gcc which is well maintained by CentOS. The VRSC also makes available modules with newer versions of gcc and the intel compilers. See the Preinstalled Software List for available versions or use  module avail intel  or  module avail gcc  at the command line to see all of the versions that are available at any given time to make use of them. To access the software use  module load gcc  or  module load intel . Note that after using these compilers you will probably need to load the modules again in the future to run the code you compiled as well.What is Galaxy?Galaxy is a web-based interface to software on Ceres in which users can build analysis workflows. See Getting Started with Galaxy on SCINet. General information about Galaxy as well as training guides can be found at galaxyproject.org.How do I login to SCINet Galaxy?Go to galaxy.scinet.usda.gov. Enter your email address and SCINet password followed by Verification code. See Getting Started with Galaxy on SCINet for more details.How do I request software to be loaded onto SCINet Galaxy?Please submit software install request at https://e.arsnet.usda.gov/sites/OCIO/scinet/Pages/SCINet-New-Application.aspx and check next to Galaxy Application.Storage SpaceHow much data can I store on Ceres?Each user is allowed 10GB of data in the home directory.Additional storage can be provided on Ceres and/or Atlas in /project directories. To request more storage see How do I request an increase in storage space?. Project directory storage is large, fast, not backed up, and can be requested up to 1TB or larger if justified. Project directory storage is good for fast I/O to large data files from compute nodes. Keep directory storage is smaller and slower, but is backed up nightly and can be requested up to 100GB or larger if justified. Keep directory storage is good for medium-term storage of analysis results and project software/scripts.When requesting additional data storage you will be asked for a project summary, a project end date, and to detail your long-term plan for data in your project/keep directories after your project end date.Besides /project data can be store in the short-term storage /90daydata which has no quotas. For more information refer to the SCINet Storage Guide.How do I request an increase in storage space?Please fill out an application form at Request Project Storage (eAuthentication required, non-ARS users should contact their sponsor) to request more storage.How do I request access to a project directory?Only project directory managers can request access to their project space for other users.Data TransferHow do I get my data onto and off of Ceres?SCP, SFTP, lftp (to/from Box accounts) Globus, and hard drive shipment are supported. This is described in the File Transfers section of the User Guides. If you work near Beltsville, you may also use the SCINet lab located at the National Agricultural Library (NAL). Two computers with 10GB Internet2 SCINet connections are available.How do I get my data onto Ceres via SCINet Galaxy?See Getting Started with Galaxy on Ceres.Support, Policy, O&amp;MWhat is the Virtual Research Support Core (VRSC)?The Virtual Research Support Core is a team of Iowa State University and ARS personnel who manage the maintenance and operation of the Ceres HPC system and provide user support. See the Virtual Research Support Core page and How do I contact the VRSC for assistance? for more details.How do I contact the VRSC for assistance?Contact scinet_vrsc@usda.gov for operational issues affecting a single user such as:   I can’t login   I’m having problems with a batch script   I’m have a problem with storage   How do I use software package X?   Please update software application X on Ceres.   Please add user X to project Y. Use the SCINet Forum message board (must have SCINet account to access) for discussions/questions about the best practices for research computations.For Galaxy questions, please use the same email contact scinet_vrsc@usda.govWho is the SCINet program manager?The current acting SCINet program manager is Rob Butler.What is the Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC)?The Scientific Advisory Committee is composed of ARS scientists across all the five physical Areas, NAL, and a representative from the Area Statisticians. These scientists serve 3-year terms on the committee and represent a broad spectrum of the computational research efforts within ARS. The SAC, which is also referred to as the executive SAC (eSAC), interacts directly with the SCINet Executive Committee on SCINet policy, development, and training.There is a call for new SAC members every spring. If you would like serve on the SAC, please discuss your interest with your supervisor and email the SAC Chair. Current SAC members can be found on the SCINet Organization page.Parallel ComputingHow do I write a batch script to submit a compute job?Please use the Ceres job script generator. The Atlas user guide provides similar generator for the Atlas cluster.How do I compile MPI codes?Load the module for the MPI library you wish to use, generally open openmpi, but mpich is available as well. MPI is included by default with the intel compiler.module avail openmpi module load openmpi The table below summarizes the relevant GNU compiler names and command line flags for serial, OpenMP and MPI codes.                       Serial       MPI       OpenMP       MPI+OpenMP                       Fortran       gfortran       mpif90       gfortran -fopenmp       mpif90 -fopenmp                 C       gcc       mpicc       gcc -fopenmp       mpicc -fopenmp                 C++       g++       mpicxx       g++ -fopenmp       mpicxx -fopenmp         Technical IssuesMy terminal window keeps freezing. Is there something I can do to stop this?As a result of the current networking infrastructure, working at the command line can be difficult sometimes because displaying hundreds of lines freezes the display. The solution to this is to enable SSH compression. There are a few different ways to do ssh using compression: do  ssh -C  from the command line; or instead of ssh in Putty, click on SSH on the left, then check Enable Compression In Unix; or alter your ~/.ssh/config file to contain these lines:Host ceres.scinet.usda.gov   Compression yes I log in at the command line but the system keeps logging me out. Is there something I can do to stop this?On Linux or Mac OS just create or add the following to a ~/.ssh/config file. If you use Windows Powershell to login to Ceres the config file will be located at C:/Users/username/.ssh/config.Host ceres HostName ceres.scinet.usda.gov User  ForwardAgent yes ForwardX11 yes TCPKeepAlive yes ServerAliveInterval 20 ServerAliveCountMax 30 That will send a “keepalive” signal every 20 seconds and keep retrying for up to 30 failures. This also simplifies your login to just: ssh ceresIf you don’t want to use the config file method you can just add these options to the ssh command:ssh -o TCPKeepAlive=yes -o ServerAliveInterval=20 -o ServerAliveCountMax=30 @ceres.scinet.usda.gov -XA Using PuTTY on windows you can do the same via the Connections tab. Set the “Seconds between keepalives” to 20 and check the “Enable TCP keepalives”"

We are pushing the limits of current technology to produce long-read sequencing data from individual specimens, despite the challenges of small body sizes, and sometimes large genomes, presented by arthropods. Arthropod pests of US field crops, livestock, bees, trees, and stored products as well as foreign pest species considered potential invasive threats to US agriculture are being considered.Ag100Pest teams are developing best practices in many arenas from process and data management to extraction, sequencing, assembly, and annotation that will benefit the entire genomics community. As an example, we collaborated in the development of an open-source functional annotation workflow specifically tailored to arthropods, which users can find installed on Ceres or available through CyVerse, Docker, and GitHub.This initiative enhances the agency’s contribution to two international genome sequencing projects – i5K (the 5000 insect genomes initiative) and the Earth BioGenome Project (to sequence the genomes of all of the world’s 1.5 million animals and plants).

      "content" : "The AI CoE was able to fund four AI Innovation Fund proposals in FY2021.  The program was very competitive, with many more proposals submitted (nearly 60!) than we could support.  Information about the funded projects is provided below.Funded proposalsExplainable Deep Learning-Based Image Analysis With Blackbird RGB Imaging Robot For Laboratory High Throughput Phenotyping   PI and Co-PIs: Lance Cadle-Davidson, Yu Jiang   Amount of award: $100,000.00   Abstract: We developed and in 2021 will commercialize the Blackbird computer vision platform, which images 200 samples per hour at 1-micron resolution for deep learning-based analysis of foliar disease severity, with better accuracy than manual microscopy.  To broaden its impact to other foliar traits (eg, trichomes, stomata), tissues (eg, roots, flowers, seeds, small fruits), and organisms (eg, insects, nematodes, fish embryos), we are adapting different lenses, sensors, and grids for imaging. Here we propose to develop a documented, containerized platform for model development and deployment and image analysis at SCINet. To test its implementation in ARS labs, this project will provide two Blackbird robots to labs selected by NP301 in consultation with Breeding Insight and will guide those labs through imaging and data analysis. In the process, we will develop training materials to facilitate widespread deployment of Blackbird in ARS and university labs as a uniform phenotyping platform. Automated Detection Of Prairie Dog Colonies From Airborne Imagery Using Deep Learning   PI and Co-PIs: David Augustine, Justin Derner, Lauren Porensky   Amount of award: $83,790.00   Abstract: Black-tailed prairie dogs are keystone species for rangeland ecosystem health in semi-arid environments, but their colonies and populations of individuals are susceptible to dramatic boom and bust cycles.  Prairie dogs alter the vegetation quantity with their grazing and burrowing activities, which presents competition for grazing livestock.  As a result, public lands managers use control measures to prevent the expansion of colonies to adjacent private properties, as well as to maintain adequate forage for grazing livestock. These management decisions require detailed information on how colony boundaries are changing over time, but such information is cost-prohibitive to collect on the ground to the dynamic nature of colonies and the vast spatial extent across which they are found. This hinders the effectiveness of interventions and makes it difficult to communicate with ranchers, conservation groups, and other stakeholders about why and how decisions are being made. We propose to develop an algorithm based on deep learning, specifically a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), to delineate prairie dog colony boundaries from high spatial resolution airborne imagery. Since DCNN’s can detect high-level features in imagery based on multi-scale patterns and morphology, we hypothesize that an algorithm can be developed to detect the distinct spatial patterns created by prairie dog colonies through burrowing and defoliation. In addition to optimizing the DCNN architecture itself, we will also identify which input layers are needed and evaluate how performance changes with coarsening spatial resolution to identify appropriate sensors and/or flight altitudes to maximize the efficiency of future monitoring. Deep Learning-Based 3D Fruit-Tree Perception through Efficient Multi-Sensor Fusion for Robotic Harvesting of Apples   PI and Co-PIs: Renfu Lu, Zhaojian Li   Amount of award: $99,240.25   Abstract: Harvest automation is critically needed for addressing labor shortage and increasing labor cost, worker safety, and profitability and sustainability of the U.S. apple industry. This project is intended to develop a unified, efficient perception system to provide 3D fruit and tree branch information to support real-time robotic planning and controls. Built on our preliminary work for a single-sensor perception system, we will evaluate multi-sensor perception systems to substantially improve apple detection and localization performance by extending the 3D detection and localization capability to tree trunk and branches. To that end, we propose two sensing paradigms: 1) multiple RGB-D cameras from different angles of viewing; and 2) camera-LiDAR fusion. We will investigate novel pre-fusion and post-fusion strategies to systematically combine these sensors for enhanced fruit and tree branch detection and localization. We will develop algorithms for efficient dynamic moving window perception to support real-time robotic operation on a resource-limited platform. Extensive evaluations of the new multi-sensor systems will be performed in both artificial and real orchards under different lighting and canopy conditions. This research is expected to provide comprehensive orchard databases with multi-modal sensors and efficient deep learning based fruit-tree perception algorithms for robotic harvesting of apples. Adapting Deep Learning For Three-Dimensional Mapping Of Soil Carbon   PI and Co-PIs: Kristen Veum, Curtis Ransom, Ken Sudduth, Newell Kitchen   Amount of award: $86,345.00   Abstract: Agricultural lands can be a sink for carbon and play an important role to help the United States become carbon neutral. Current methods of measuring carbon sequestration -through repeated temporal soil samples- are costly and laborious. A promising alternative is using visible, near-infrared (VNIR) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. However, VNIR data are complex, which requires several data processing steps and often yields inconsistent results, especially when using in situ VNIR measurements. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN) could bypass these steps and incorporate measurements from multiple sensors to predict three-dimensional carbon stocks. A CNN modeling framework will be developed to predict soil carbon by incorporating information from profile VNIR, apparent electrical conductivity (ECa), penetration resistance measurements, and spatial covariates (e.g., mobile-sensor ECa and topography). Improvements over traditional modeling methods will be reported. Additional objectives include evaluating the optimal spatial density of sensor measurements needed to use the CNN model to estimate soil carbon. These models will be used to develop three-dimensional (down to 1 m) estimates of soil carbon which will quantify carbon sequestration over five years from fields with contrasting management history.

      "content" : "The ARS AI Center of Excellence (AI-COE) funded five AI Innovation Fund proposals in FY2022.  The program was again very competitive, with many more proposals submitted (&gt;30) than we could support.  Information about the funded projects is provided below.Funded proposalsBeeMachine 2.0: development of machine learning approaches to rapidly identify bee museum specimens from digital images   PI and Co-PIs: Michael Branstetter, Brian Spiesman, Terry Griswold, Jonathan Koch   Amount of award: $52,555   Abstract: Bees have great value as pollinators of crops, natural plant communities, and backyard gardens. Identifying factors that affect bee diversity are therefore important for ensuring pollination services and food security. The global decline of bees, especially in agricultural regions, underscores the need for conservation research, including survey and monitoring efforts. A major impediment for studying bees, however, is that they are extremely diverse, with &gt;4,000 North American species, and they are challenging to identify, especially by non-specialists. One potential solution to solve the identification impediment is the automated identification of bee species from digital images using machine learning and computer vision approaches. Such methods have been recently tested using field images of U.S. bumble bee species. The project was successful and the results were deployed in a web application called “BeeMachine.” Although promising, extending the approach to all bee species will be a major undertaking requring the generation of many more digital images of expertly identified specimens. We propose a collaboration between BeeMachine, the U.S. National Pollinating Insects Collection, and SCINet to improve the ability of deep learning models to automate bee identification from images. Focusing on three bee genera of agricultural importance (Bombus, Osmia, Megachile), we will generate digital images of 15,000 museum specimens representing 300+ species, and we will train a convolutional neural network using SCINet resources. We will use a subset of the images to validate the approach and check the accuracy of the model. We will also compare image-based identification to DNA-based methods by sequencing the barcode gene for a subset of specimens. This research will move the bee research community closer to an all-bee classifier and expand bee-identification tools. All images will be archived and results will be integrated online in the BeeMachine web app. Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) for spatiotemporal modeling of pest insects   PI and Co-PIs: John Humphreys, Guofeng Cao, Bob Srygley, Dave Branson   Amount of award: $100,000   Abstract: Emerging GeoAI and deep-learning methods hold significant promise to revolutionize how agricultural problems are addressed, however the potential to adapt these methods to insect pest detection and management remains largely untapped and is often confounded by the statistical complexity of analyzing enormous quantities of multi-scale, multi-source data (Big Data) that exhibit complex spatiotemporal structure. We propose to leverage the SCINet high-performance computing infrastructure to aid in the development of new uncertainty-aware, GeoAI-based tools that employ neural network algorithms, deep learning methods, and related machine learning tools. These new tools will be used to characterize and model the complex spatiotemporal patterns connected to pest grasshopper outbreaks across the Western US. Grasshoppers are the most impactful rangeland insect pests in the US, cause rangeland forage losses of about $1.67 billion annually, and routinely inflict major crop damage. Grasshopper outbreaks in 2021 occurred at near record levels, caused serious economic injury in many states, and prompted massive public interest in agricultural pest management.  For 2022, more than 80 million acres in the West are anticipated to be at economic risk with millions of dollars already requested for treatments and chemical control on federal lands. The combined use of multispectral imagery, derived environmental data sets, and our novel uncertainty-aware approach will enable the distinctive signature of grasshopper habitat to be identified while concurrently quantifying grasshopper density variation at the local scale to improve pest outbreak forecasts. Modernizing Dietary Assessment: Adapting Deep Learning to Predict Ingredients from Food Photos   PI and Co-PIs: Danielle Lemay, Hamed Pirsiavash   Amount of award: $99,157   Abstract: Current dietary assessment methods are extremely burdensome for participants and contain substantial errors and biases. Artificial intelligence methods can be used to identify food from photo-based food diaries, which would enable convenient and real-time dietary data capture. Specifically, identification of individual foods and ingredients in photos are necessary for accurate dietary analysis and mapping to food and nutrient databases. Existing deep learning algorithms that predict recipes and ingredients from photos are promising but are trained on data that do not reflect eating patterns and food consumed “in the wild.” These methods need to be evaluated and adapted to predict ingredients from food photo diaries for dietary assessment. We propose to evaluate, compare, and adapt existing deep learning algorithms for prediction of ingredients from real-world food photos from our SNAPMe human nutrition study, which contains food photos paired with traditional food recalls (text-based) collected from healthy human participants. To improve prediction of food diaries from human studies, we will then fine-tune the most promising model on data with a variety of food types and food representations, including multi-cultural foods, core (single ingredient) foods, and food photos collected from human study participant smartphone cameras. This project will provide an algorithm for ingredient-level prediction from food photo diaries used for dietary assessment, and an evaluation of that algorithm on real-world benchmark data. Microbial Water Quality Determinations using Machine Learning: Application and Algorithm Comparison   PI and Co-PIs: Yakov Pachepsky, Matthew Stocker   Amount of award: $100,000   Abstract: During irrigation events, dangerous microorganisms can be transported to crops and soils with contaminated waters. To assess the potential presence of pathogenic microorganisms in irrigation waters, the concentrations of the fecal indicator bacteria, Escherichia coli (E. coli), are routinely measured and are compared to regulatory standards. However, methods of enumerating E. coli are labor-intensive and costly and the long analysis time means results may not be representative of current conditions. For these reasons, researchers often elect to develop predictive models for E. coli concentrations based on the levels of physicochemical, hydrological, and meteorological variables, which can be rapidly and easily measured. However, due to the complexity of aquatic ecosystems and nonlinearity in relationships between predictor variables and E. coli in surface waters, traditional statistical approaches often struggle to effectively characterize the dependency of E. coli concentrations on the measured predictor variables. Recently, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have been shown to provide timely and accurate predictions of the microbial quality of recreational and drinking water sources. Still, little work has been done to apply ML to irrigation water quality. The objectives set in this proposal are to 1) comprehensively evaluate over 100 ML algorithms for the prediction of E. coli in irrigation waters and 2) to determine the most important environmental variables governing the presence of E. coli in irrigation waters. We propose analyzing one of the largest microbial water quality databases in existence which was generated in the USDA-ARS Environmental Microbial and Food Safety Laboratory and contains over 95,000 unique measurements of E. coli and environmental variables collected at multiple field sites from 2016 to 2021. This research is expected to create powerful ML models which will be used to expedite and improve microbial water quality determinations and ultimately food safety in the United States and abroad. Putting AI technology into the hands of farmers: Developing an app to make intelligent decisions using deep learning   PI and Co-PIs: Zhanyou Xu, Jo Heuschele, Zhou Zhang   Amount of award: $100,000   Abstract: Alfalfa is the third most valuable field crop after corn and soybean in the U.S., valued at about $10 billion annually. Climate, soil, and genetics affect alfalfa’s digestibility and biomass yield differently, with the paradox of high yield but low digestibility or high digestibility but low yield. Finding the optimal harvest window for desired yield and digestibility is one of the most critical decisions alfalfa farmers must make four to seven times every year. Low digestibility in alfalfa limits dry matter intake and energy availability in ruminant (dairy and beef) production systems, while low biomass yield reduces farmers’ profitability. Measuring forage digestibility is labor and resource-intensive, often with long turnaround times to obtain data. Computer vision-based deep learning analysis provides the opportunity to quickly predict digestibility and yield to help farmers and researchers make intelligent decisions. The goal of this proposal is to develop a mobile application decision tool (a cell phone app) using three convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Google Net, VGG-Block, and Reset with Google deep learning system “TensorFlow.” The app will have the capacity to 1) estimate alfalfa digestibility and yield in real-time; 2) measure the stems and plants per square foot to forecast yield potential and nitrogen credits to support decisions on stand termination; and 3) predict the harvest window for yield and quality goals taking into the account historical weather patterns and weather forecasts. Ultimately, the app will help farmers make AI-based decisions for increased economic returns for alfalfa production. The expected product of this proposal, a beta testing version 0.5, will be available for ARS internal testing in 2022. The farmer version 1.0 of the app will be launched as a free download for use by the end of 2023 in the Apple Store and 2024 in the Google Play Store. "

This is delivered through monthly teleconferences and webinars by internal and external scientists focused on genome assembly, gene and protein expression, population genomics, and reverse genetic (RNAi and CRISPR) approaches. The AGR was initiated following two organizational meetings in 2014 (AGR Workshop I) and 2016 (AGR Workshop II), at which participants communicated needs and devised solutions for challenging analytical pipelines. The AGR facilitates internal and external collaborations by merging those with complementary knowledge, skills, and capabilities within a given research area. Collaborations among AGR members have also resulted in two published papers reviewing ARS arthropod genomics research1 and developing RNAi and CRISPR technologies2.  Work within the AGR includes the Ag100Pest Initiative, which aims to provide reference quality genome sequence assemblies for arthropod pests of U.S. agricultural commodities.The AGR is open to anyone within ARS, and those interested in joining can contact Brad Coates.

The system is configured with a login node, which users access to submit compute jobs to the SLURM scheduler.Compute jobs are run on functional groups of nodes called partitions or queues. Each partition has different capabilities (e.g. regular memory versus high memory nodes) and resource restrictions (e.g. time limits on jobs). There are 10+ different partitions on Ceres to which users can submit compute jobs. For details on the current partitions/queues, see ‘Partitions or Queues’ in the User Guides.Members of the SCINet Virtual Research Support Core (VRSC) in Ames, IA are the operational administrators of the Ceres HPC cluster. The VRSC maintains the system hardware, software, and provides user support. To learn more about the VRSC, visit the VRSC page. For a current list of command-line software managed by the VRSC through the module system, see the Preinstalled Software List.All Ceres users (ARS and formal collaborators) receive 5GB of storage in their /home directory and can request additional storage in a /project directory.Additional technical information about the Ceres HPC cluster can be found in the Ceres User Manual.New users may also want to reference the Quick Start Guide.Many additional user guides are available under the “User Guides” dropdown list.Other helpful links:  Apply for a SCINet Account to access Ceres  SCINet/Ceres FAQs  Request Project Storage  Request Software Atlas HPC Cluster | Starkville, MSARS researchers also have access to a Cray system in Starkville, MS through an agreement with the Mississippi State University (MSU) to supplement Agency scientific computing capacity. Same SCINet credentials are used to connect to Atlas as to other SCINet HPC clusters.Atlas cluster consists of 228 standard compute nodes, 8 high memory compute nodes and 4 GPU nodes. All nodes run on Linux Centos and compute jobs are managed by the SLURM scheduler. The system is configured with a login node, which users access to submit compute jobs to the SLURM scheduler.

      "content" : "  By: Erin ScullyUse CaseARS scientists in several locations throughout the United States are combining forces to provide high quality genome assemblies, gene models, and functional annotations for the 100 most dangerous and damaging arthropod pests of US agriculture in an effort called the Ag100Pest Initiative. Insect genomes are surprisingly complex and variable, ranging from slightly over 100 Mb to over 2 Gb in size. Furthermore, their structural complexities vary as many arthropod genomes contain multicopy gene families arranged in large tandem arrays and large repetitive regions. Using new methods for generating long-read sequencing libraries from low DNA inputs typically obtained from single small-bodied insects, genome assemblies of several arthropods have been generated using PacBio Sequel II instrument and assembled using tools deployed on the SCINet Ceres HPC system, including the spotted lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula) quarantine pest (see Kingan et al. 2019).As part of this initiative, a functional annotation pipeline was developed to facilitate the addition of Gene Ontology (GO) terms, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotations, and IntePproScan results to gene models generated for de novo genome and transcriptome projects. Unlike other GO tools, this pipeline allows the user to customize criteria for adding GO and KEGG terms to gene models, such as the degree of functional validation, minimum bit scores, raw scores, e-values, and percent identities. This tool is now deployed on the SCINet Ceres HPC system.The National Agricultural Library (NAL) maintains all Ag100Pest genome assemblies and annotations at the i5k workspace. Integration with WebApollo facilitates manual curation and sharing of gene sets of interest with collaborators.Tools and SoftwareARS is among the world’s leading producer and user of genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and other -omics data for non-model organisms of agricultural importance, including pathogens, insects, animals, and plants. On-going projects in the agency related to these efforts include de novo genome and transcriptome assembly and annotation, whole genome resequencing for population, strain, and biotype analyses, and comparative genomics and gene family evolution.SCINet hosts the following tools to facilitate these studies (see the Preinstalled Software List for a full list of software currently available on Ceres):GOanna Gene Ontology tool (see instructions for using on Ceres)Genome assemblersfor long-reads, short-reads, and hybrid approaches and tools for generating Hi-C maps:  ALLPATHS, Canu, DISCOVAR, FALCON, Juicer, MECAT, SALSA, SOAPdenovo, SPAdes, and SupernovaTranscriptome assemblersABySS, Trinity, and VelvetGene prediction and annotation toolsAugustus, BUSCO, GeneMark, Glimmer, InterProScan, MAKER, Prokka, RepeatMasker , RepeatModeler, TransDecoder, Trinotate, and tRNAScanRNA-Seq analysisBallgown, Bowtie, Cufflinks, HISAT2, kallisto, PASA, Salmon, and StringtieComparative GenomicsBLAST, Circos, DIAMOND, MCScanX, and OrthoFinderPhylogeneticsGARLI, PhyML, and RAxMLGUI tools for working with genomic dataFloating licenses for Geneious Prime GUI (graphic user interface) tools are available through SCINet.Additionally, GUI server licenses for CLC Workbench are also available.A Galaxy instance is also available on Ceres, allowing users to run popular command line tools through a GUI.

Users also can upload other freely-available software to suite their research needs.Use CaseARS scientists in Boise, Idaho at the Northwest Watershed Research Center (NWRC) utilize SCINet and Amazon Web Service (AWS) cloud computing to run iSnobal, ARS’s physically based snow model, with frequent airborne lidar surveys. SCINet and AWS allow scientists to efficiently and effectively deliver model results in real time to water managers in California. Snowpack summary reports are uploaded to AWS where they can be displayed and downloaded on the NWRC website. The spatial snowpack results are publicly available through a GIS server where collaborators can download the data or visualize real time model results.

The SAC is an effort to assure that users have input on the ARS HPC-storage system. Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) members represent a broad range of scientific research at ARS, and membership includes two researchers from each of the five ARS geographic areas, a statistician, and an “at-large” member. The SAC divides its work over various subcommittees: communications, education, planning, and membership. In recent years, the SAC has assisted with a quarterly SCINet newsletter, designed a user needs survey, created the scinet.usda.gov website, and held multiple computational workshops and trainings. SAC progress and issues are elevated to the Executive Committee for review and approval.

Working with the SCINet Operations Team, the Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) and the SAC subcommittees to ensure location personnel are familiar with SCINet and the services that are offered, the SPOC should be familiar with the scientific needs of the unit(s) at their location, especially with respect to complex data and computational needs. When the SCINet Operations Team needs information about the science requirements and needs at a location, they will contact the SPOC who is expected to interact with other scientists within the location to provide the information and recommendations to the requesting party.The list of SPOC can be found on the USDA Sharepoint Site.SCINet Policy CommitteeFormed in 2020, this committee makes recommendations to the Executive Committee on policies and procedures relevant to HPC operations. The committee is comprised of members from various technical backgrounds, and includes representation from different ARS geographic areas. Membership also includes representatives from Iowa State University and Mississippi State University (where two of the ARS HPC systems are housed) in order to get representation and perspective of the issues that need to be addressed.

      "content" : "By: Justin VaughnThe USDA’s National Plant Germplasm System maintains the world’s foremost collection of crop diversity. In order the make that diversity useful to breeders and stakeholders, the USDA seeks to characterize the agronomic and, more recently, genetic properties of the plants in these collections. Genome sequencing is the ultimate genetic characterization of an individual. To that end, the USDA is engaged in sequencing key individuals to represent each crop. This information, when combined with trait data, can reveal the genetic basis of plant traits.When a reference genome of a species is available, sequencing an individual usually involves getting millions of short sequence reads from random parts of the genome and then aligning those reads to the reference. Once aligned, additional algorithms are used to identity differences relative to the reference, which requires extensive computation. Though it is possible to process a few whole genomes on local computers, USDA’s crop collections range from hundreds to thousands of individuals. With its multi-threaded architecture and large static and dynamic memory capacity, SCINet’s computational cluster, Ceres, makes work on this scale possible.Use CaseARS scientists are currently characterizing numerous crop collections at the whole genome level. Two examples, spearheaded by the Genomics and Bioinformatics Research Unit (GBRU), are focused on US rice and cotton. GBRU in collaboration with the Dale Bumper National Rice Research Center has sequenced 166 rice varieties and produced a gold-standard set of genetic variants in rice. This effort required months of processing time on Ceres as well as software developed in human genetics (HaplotypeCaller). These variants will be released to RiceBase (ricebase.org) and can be explored in an interactive app called HaploStrata (github.com/USDA-ARS-GBRU/HaploStrata). Cotton, because of its complex history and polyploid structure, is still in the process of being analyzed on Ceres. When finished, the results will be coupled with phenotypic data to give new insight into the regions of the genome that can be targeted to further enhance the US fiber industry.See also this Ceres data processing tutorial for plant breeding scientists: Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) Analysis for Breeding"

If you only need a different version of a software package that is already installed on CERES please email scinet_vrsc@USDA.GOV.        Consider whether you should install the software yourself in your home or project directory - see the Preinstalled Software List for more details.    You may want to use Conda for package, dependency, and environment management- see this guide about how to use conda on SCINet.    If you’re not sure whether you should install software yourself or if you need help, email scinet_vrsc@USDA.GOV. Software that will be useful to many SCINet users should be installed as a module by the VRSC.  How to send a software requestIf you’ve done the above but need new software installed as a module, use the software request form (eAuthentication required, non-ARS users should contact their sponsor):Software Request FormNote: doing this requires an agency-level security review and takes a few weeks.Storage RequestWhen a user applies for a SCINet account, they are allocated space on Ceres in a /home directory. Each user is allowed 10GB of data in the home directory.Users are advised to request additional space in the /project directory. Project directory storage is large, fast, not backed up, and can be requested up to 1TB or larger if justified. Project directory storage is good for fast I/O to large data files from compute nodes. The new project requests and request for changes must be submitted by the ARS project’s Principal Investigator (PI).To Modify an Existing SCINet Project AllocationThe PI should send an email that includes:  the name of the project directory (/project/&lt;projectname&gt;/) and  the requested changesto the SCINet Virtual Research Support Core (VRSC) scinet_vrsc@USDA.GOV.To Request a Quota Increase for an Existing SCINet Project AllocationSCINet users have access to a large short-term storage /90daydata which has no quotas. When requesting a project quota increase on Ceres or Atlas the PI will need to justify the request and explain why using /90daydata is not sufficient.To request project quota increase for storage on Ceres, Atlas and/or Juno fill out the following application form:Request Project Quota IncreasePlease Note: Only the project manager or the project PI can request a quota increase. Any requests sent by other individuals will be declined.To Request a New Project AllocationWhen requesting additional data storage you will be asked for:  a project summary,  project end date,  and to detail your long-term plan for data in your project directory after your project end date.To request a new project directory, fill out an application form (eAuthentication required, non-ARS users should contact their sponsor):Request Project StorageAWS RequestSCINet provides AWS at no cost to SCINet users with suitable workloads. A limited amount of funding is available annually. Interested SCINet users must submit a SCINet AWS Project Request to be considered for AWS funding.To Add/Modify AWS Resources for an Existing SCINet ProjectSend an email that includes:  the name of the project directory (/project/&lt;projectname&gt;/) and  the requested changesto the SCINet Virtual Research Support Core scinet_vrsc@USDA.GOV.This includes requests for additional funding.To Request a New SCINet-funded AWS ProjectFill out an application form (eAuthentication required, non-ARS users should contact their sponsor)Request AWS ProjectRequests will be reviewed and projects funded based on criteria such as suitability for AWS versus other SCINet computing resources (e.g., Ceres, Atlas), resource requirements estimated from the project description, and availability of SCINet funding."

If you need to keep something, use /KEEP/PROJECTNAMEAdditional warning:  If you download archived files, they may contain files with an access date from long ago. This date will still trigger deletion, so make sure that the files have a new access date. For example, when you untar a .tar or .tgz file, use the -m flag. If you use rsync to the space, do not use the -a flag, as that preserves date stamps.The name of this space is /90daydata, and it will go live Thursday, 8/27/20 at noon EDT.The VRSC will create a directory /90daydata/PROJECTNAME for each /project/PROJECTNAME  directory, so that there is no confusion among different groups.There will also be a space /90daydata/shared open to all for the passing of data between project groups.

Please take the time to read over the document to make sure that you are compliant with all SCINet policies and regulations.  A few examples of the changes in SCINet policy include:1) Accounts will be deactivated if there is one year of account inactivity.2) Passwords reset after 60 days.3) Collaborator (Non-ARS) accounts expire after one year.4) Non-ARS SCINet users must confirm that they have taken Annual Security Awareness Training and at the beginning of each year. The VRSC will send out emails to confirm account status eligibility.5) To clarify the policy on hardware purchases - when a node is purchased, it belongs to the priority pool and the purchaser has access to the priority queue for the period of the node hardware warranty. The purchaser does not own the physical node, and the property sticker belongs to the SCINet.6) SCINet is a community resource. Thus, all SCINet users have a responsibility to the other users on the system. There are restrictions on what software you can install.7) There is a /90daydata folder where you can perform analysis to save resources in your project directory. The data is then automatically deleted after 90 days with no back-up.These policy changes were approved by the SCINet Policy Committee for the safety of SCINet and to encourage a positive SCINet experience for all users. The Committee is made up of Scientists, Bioinformaticians and IT professionals across ARS. If you have a question or need clarification, please contact the chair of the SCINet policy committee. Details of the SCINet policy can be found on the following SharePoint page."

  "content" : "Ceres cluster maintenance is scheduled for the week of February 20, 2023. This will be a major upgrade, as Ceres is being upgraded from EL 7 to EL 9.  We will rebuild the software modules to run on the new OS. If you have installed software on your own, you may need to rebuild it under the new OS as well.  During the maintenance we will also upgrade File system which should resolve the issue with fasterq-dump locking up nodes.  Some network changes will be performed during the maintenance.  Users with no projects will be moved from scinet account to sandbox account. It’s expected that SCINet users have access to a project to perform meaningful computations on Ceres and/or Atlas. To request a project, go to our request resources page.A lot of preparation work will be done prior to the maintenance, but we still may encounter problems during the update process.  We will send a follow up message when Ceres is available again.Note that queued jobs will not start if they cannot complete by 6AM February 20. In the output of the squeue command the reason for those jobs will state (ReqNodeNotAvail, Reserved for maintenance). The jobs will start after the scheduled outage completes.If you anticipate the need to access HPC resources during the week of February 20, 2023, we advise moving to Atlas cluster which will be available during the Ceres maintenance. Make sure to copy data from Ceres to Atlas prior to the maintenance if needed.Please submit any questions you may have via email to scinet_vrsc@usda.gov."

  "content" : "Digital technologies are valuable tools that may help farmers improve efficiency and make better decisions. Remote sensing has been a key source of data from the early days of digital agriculture and has been linked to crop mapping, biophysical variables, yield forecasting, and prescriptive analytics required to monitor crop growth and agricultural output from the field scale to the global scale. The remote sensing sector has never been more capable of helping deliver on the promises of digital agriculture, thanks to recent developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence. But there are some problems and limitations that need to be fixed before these technologies can be used effectively and agriculture is digitally transformed on a large scale. These include accuracy, interoperability, data storage, computational capacity, and farmers’ reluctance to use them. The seminar will focus on two case studies: retrieval of crop biophysical parameters from UAV hyperspectral imagery and fruit detection using high-resolution UAV RGB imagery."

What are “AI training images”?  AI-based image analysis techniques typically require relatively large image datasets – “training images” – to help the AI system improve its performance on a given analysis task.  Obtaining suitable training images is often one of the most expensive and time-consuming aspects of applying AI image analyses in scientific research.On February 28, 2023, from 12-4 pm EST, ARS’s AI Center of Excellence will host a virtual workshop to help lay the foundations for building shared AI training image resources for ARS research.  We will:   Help attendees gain a better understanding of AI image analysis methods, how they are used in ARS, and why we need agency-wide training image resources.   Identify training image requirements and use cases.   Begin to develop an inventory of extant training image datasets. At the beginning of the workshop, we will host a lightning talk session for attendees to share their work using AI-based image analyses.

  "content" : "The login node provides access to a wide variety of scientific software tools that users can access and use via the module system. These software tools were compiled and optimized for use on SCINet by members of the Virtual Research Support Core (VRSC) team. Most users will find the software tools they need for their research among the provided packages and thus will not need to compile their own software packages.The popular R, Perl, and Python languages have many packages/modules available. Some of the packages are installed on Ceres and are available with the r/perl/python_2/python_3 modules. To see the list of installed packages, visit the Preinstalled Software List page or use  module help &lt;module_name&gt;  command. If users need packages that are not available, they can either request VRSC to add packages, or they can download and install packages in their home/project directories. We recommend installing packages in the project directories since collaborators on the same project most probably would need the same packages. In addition, home quotas are much lower than project directories quotas. See the Guide to Installing R, Python, and Perl Packages for instructions and examples on how to add packages/modules for these languages.If users would like to compile their own software with GNU compilers, they will need to load the gcc module. It is recommended to compile on compute nodes and not on the login node. However, before embarking on compiling their own software packages we strongly encourage users to contact the VRSC team to ensure that their required tool(s) might not be better distributed as a shared package within the official software modules tree. All new software needs to be approved by SOC committee before being centrally installed on the system. To request a new software package to be installed, visit the Request Software page."

On Atlas “quota -s” command reports usage and quota for the home directory and “/apps/bin/reportFSUsage -p proj1,proj2,proj3” provides that information for specific projects.SoftwareNot all software installed on Ceres is available on Atlas. However software packages provided as Singularity container image files in the Ceres Container Repository are synced to Atlas daily.Using ContainersOn both clusters some modules are installed as singularity containers. On Ceres, all modules, including container based, are displayed in the output of the “module avail” command. On Atlas one needs to load a singularity module (“module load singularity” or “module load singularity/&lt;version&gt;”) to make the “singularity” command accessible and to see container based modules:module load singularity module avail Furthermore, on Atlas one needs to explicitly issue singularity command to use a container based software:singularity exec &lt;container image&gt; On Ceres, loading a container-based module will also load a singularity module, and one does not need to type the “singularity exec ...” command since it’s already built in the module. One can use “module help &lt;module_name&gt;” command to get information on how to use the software package provided by the module.Seeing All Environment ModulesSimilar to containers, some modules on Atlas are not reported by the “module avail” command and can not be loaded without loading an appropriate gcc module:module load gcc/10.2.0 module avail module load canu/2.2 To see all available modules on Atlas, one can use “module spider” command instead of the “module avail” command. This command will also work on Ceres, but it’s not necessary to use it.Atlas-login-1[7] marina.kraeva$ module spider canu  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   canu: --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Versions:         canu/2.1.beta         canu/2.1         canu/2.2  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   For detailed information about a specific canu package (including how to load the modules) use the module's full name.   Note that names that have a trailing (E) are extensions provided by other modules.   For example:       $ module spider canu/2.2 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CondaTo build a Conda environment on Ceres, one can load miniconda module (“module load miniconda”). On Atlas one needs first to install miniconda in their home directory:wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh Since home directories on both clusters have 10GB quota, it’s recommended to move the installed miniconda to a project directory and create a symbolic link to the new location in the home directory:mv ~/miniconda3 /project/project_folder/software/. ln -s /project/project_folder/software/miniconda3 ~/. Submitting a JobJob scripts from one cluster may not work on the other cluster. See below what needs to be changed in the script to make it work. This also applies to the salloc/srun commands.Slurm accountTo run jobs on compute nodes of either cluster, the jobs need to be associated with a slurm account. For users that have access to one or more project directories, their slurm accounts have same names as the project directories. The slurm account for users without project directories is called sandbox. On Ceres cluster all users have a default slurm account, and thus when submitting a job, they don’t need to specify a slurm account for the job unless they want to associate the job with a non-default slurm account (this concerns only users with multiple slurm accounts; see the SCINet Ceres User Manual “Slurm Accounts” section for how to list and change the default Slurm account). On Atlas one needs to specify a slurm account when submitting a job. To specify slurm account, either use “-A &lt;slurm_account_name&gt;” on the slurm command (srun, salloc, sbatch) or add the following line to your job script:#SBATCH -A &lt;slurm_account_name&gt; PartitionsOne does not have to specify a partition when submitting a job to a default partition on either Ceres or Atlas. However scripts that have a partition specified will need to be updated when used on a different cluster. To see the list of available partitions on a cluster, either issue “sinfo” command or consult the appropriate user guide: Ceres or Atlas.NodesTwo clusters have different node types, that have different numbers of compute cores and amounts of memory. For most jobs the scripts already specify resources that are available on either cluster, so no changes need to be made. However if a job relies on the default amount of memory being large, it may fail on the other cluster that has smaller defaults. Some jobs may have high number of cores specified. On Ceres hyper-threading is turned on, meaning that each physical core on a node appears as two separate processors to the operating system and can run two threads. Because of that setting all nodes have at least 72 cores available. On Atlas, nodes have 48 cores. Thus if a script specifies more than 48 cores per node, it won’t be accepted on Atlas.Internet ConnectionOn Atlas compute nodes do not have access to internet. If your job requires internet access, either submit it to the service partition or modify the job prefetching data and using the previously downloaded data in the job. Conda installs will need to be performed either on the login or data transfer nodes.sallocOn Ceres issuing “salloc” command will allocate resources for an interactive job and log you into the node assigned to the job. On Atlas the “salloc -A &lt;slurm_account_name&gt;” command will only allocate resources, but one will still need to use srun command to utilize resources assigned to the job. To login to the node, issue “srun --pty --preserve-env bash”. Note that exiting from that session will not kill the job, and to release resources assigned to the job, you will need to issue “scancel &lt;job_number&gt;” command. Note that salloc command is not needed, and one can only use the “srun -A &lt;slurm_account_name&gt; --pty --preserve-env bash” command to use a node interactively."

Log in with your SCInet username and password. If you are presented with a role selection screen, choose your desired project to proceed to the console.AWS Service Catalog ConsoleYou must be using the US East (N. Virginia) region for all AWS activities. Please check your currently selected region before following this document’s instructions.  To check and update your region, click on the dropdown in the upper right of the console window, just next to “Support.” Select US East.(N. Virginia)In the main Console page, click on “Service Catalog” within the Management Tools section, or type “ServiceCatalog” into the search bar.   You will see all of AWS’s service offerings listed on the main page, even though your project role likely restricts your access. Don’t get overwhelmed! If you get lost, click the AWS logo in the upper left to get back to the main console.  The Service Catalog lists the products that have been assigned to your project, as well as the products that have been provisioned (launched) provisioned by you or on your behalf.   If your Service Catalog console looks different than the one in thescreenshot, you are using the “old look”. You can switch to the “newlook” by clicking on the dropdown in the upper left of Service Catalog the console and choosing. Try the new look. The products assigned to your project may differ from those shown in the screenshot. Create a resource - Launch a ProductClick the three-dots button on the desired product card and choose Launch Product, or click on the product name and click Launch Product on thefollowing screen. Step 1: Name and VersionProvide a name for the product to be launched. This name will be shown in the list of provisioned products, and must contain only letters, numbers, dashes, underscores and periods. Also. select the desired version out of the available versions.Step 2: Product ParametersFill in the parameters as made available by the product template definition.   Some parameters may have limits or requirements. If you receive a warning message saying ‘abcde must equal the value of “Parameter”’, copy and paste the value on the left-hand side into the parameter field to proceed through the warning.  Step 3: TagOptionsYou may provide optional tags to help you locate and track your resources. For most users, the default tags are sufficient.Steps 4-5: Notifications and ReviewContinue through the Notifications screen by clicking Next. Finally, click Launch on the last page to launch the product Provisioned Product DetailsAfter initially launch, the product details page will show the product as “Under change” with status “In progress”. The page will automaticallyupdate (or you can refresh the page if desired). When complete, the product will change to “Available” with status “Succeeded” Follow the instructions in the AWS Product Documentation for more details on how to use the product you just launched.Delete a Resource - Terminate a ProductView the list of provisioned products (resources previously launched) by clicking “Provisioned products list” in the Service Catalog console menu(the three bars icon in the upper-left). From the three-dots menu, select “Terminate provisioned product”, or choose Terminate from the Actions menu within the Provisioned product details screen. Click “Terminate” to confirm termination of the product. The screen will show “Under change” to show that the product is in process of termination. "

Before you start, you should have a reasonable idea of what you’d like to spin up and about how much it may cost.Once you’re ready to begin the process, please use the stand ARS project request form to request an AWS project.  If your group already has an existing AWS project you can just request to be added to it.  Click here for the AWS project request form.This will be a space with a managed budget and controlled set of resources that you can launch, and where you can log in using your SCInet credentials.How do I log in?Visit https://auth.scinet.usda.gov/  You will need to use your SCINet password immediately folowed by your 6 digit GA code.I’m logged in fine, but I don’t see the Service Catalog that I expect. Where did it go?Make sure that you have the right region selected! Your region is shown in a dropdown menu in the upper right of the screen. It should say “N. Virginia” -if it says something like “Ohio”, click the menu and select “US East (N. Virginia)”.I’m trying to do something in the AWS Console, but I’m getting an error message saying I don’t have enough permissions. What should I do?If you’re not in the Service Catalog, then you probably aren’t allowed to take that action directly. Most creation and deletion operations must be done through the Service Catalog. If you’re trying to do something that isn’t already in the Service Catalog, contact the VRSC for assistance.  If you are in the Service Catalog, you may see occasional harmless notices of a permission problem, which I believe is due to a bug. If you see errors that are preventing you from performing a task, contact the VRSC for troubleshootingI’d like to use a service that isn’t covered in the Service Catalog. Can I have it added?The VRSC will need to evaluate whether your desired service is appropriate for being included in the Service Catalog. Some services currently aren’t suitable for various reasons; unfortunately, if this is the case, it’s likely because we couldn’t control costs or permissions for that service sufficiently to prevent other users from interfering with you. If it is possible, make the request and be patient -it can take some time to write the proper template in asecure and reliable manner."

  "url" : "/guides/software/conda",
  "description" : "Using Conda",
  "date" : "May 19, 2023",
  "content" : "Conda is a software package manager for data science that allows unprivileged (non-administrative) Linux or MacOS users to search, fetch, install, upgrade, use, and manage supported open-source software packages and programming languages/libraries/environments (primarily Python and R, but also others such as Perl, Java, and Julia) in a directory they have write access to. Conda allows SCINet users to create reproducible scientific software environments (including outside of Ceres) without requiring the submission of a SCINet software request form for new software, or contacting the VRSC to upgrade existing software. Many open-source scientific software packages are available:   Browse/search all conda packages The Bioconda channel contains thousands of software packages that are useful for bioinformatics.   Browse/search available Bioconda software packages SetupBefore using conda or conda-installed software on Ceres, the miniconda environment module (which contains the conda software environment) must be loaded. To load the latest miniconda module available on Ceres:[user.name@ceres ~]$ module load miniconda You can see all available versions of miniconda on Ceres with:[user.name@ceres ~]$ module spider miniconda (Optional one-time setup for bioconda users) If you plan on installing software primarily from the bioconda channel, before using conda for the first time on Ceres, you may wish to configure conda per the bioconda documentation to search for software packages in the conda-forge, bioconda, and defaults channels (in that order):[user.name@ceres ~]$ conda config --add channels defaults [user.name@ceres ~]$ conda config --add channels bioconda [user.name@ceres ~]$ conda config --add channels conda-forge Otherwise, the conda-forge and then bioconda channels must be specified every time software is installed via conda install or conda create:conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda SOFTWARE_PACKAGE1 SOFTWARE_PACKAGE2... Installing SoftwareSoftware can be installed into separate environments (directories) that are managed separately. At least one environment must be created before installing software using the Ceres miniconda environment module.On Ceres, suitable locations for conda environments housing conda packages include:        Home directory (default; subdirectory of $HOME/.conda/envs/)             NOTE: some Conda packages (with dependencies) can take gigabytes of storage space. Use the Ceres command  my_quota  to check the available space in your home directory.                A user-specified directory within one’s project directory, e.g.,    /project/&lt;MY_PROJECT&gt;/&lt;MY_ENVIRONMENT_DIRECTORY&gt;             This environment is then usable by others in the project.         Best Practices   Use an interactive session on a compute node to install software with conda to avoid slowing down the login node for everyone, e.g,     [user.name@ceres ~]$ salloc [user.name@ceres14-compute-60 ~]$ module load miniconda [user.name@ceres14-compute-60 ~]$ source activate my_env (my_env) [user.name@ceres14-compute-60 ~]$ conda install &lt;package_name&gt; ...         Example 1: Installing Trinity into a home directoryLoad the latest miniconda module if you haven’t already and create an environment called “trinityenv”:[user.name@ceres ~]$ module load miniconda [user.name@ceres ~]$ conda create --name trinityenv Note that the  conda create command used above without the –prefix option will create the environment in your home directory ($HOME/.conda/envs/).To activate the environment (and update environment variables such as PATH that are required to use software installed into this environment):[user.name@ceres ~]$ source activate trinityenv (trinityenv) [user.name@ceres ~]$         Do not execute conda init            In conda &ge; 4.6, if you run conda activate, you will be prompted to run conda init to modify your shell interactive startup script (e.g, ~/.bashrc):        [user.name@ceres ~]$ conda activate  CommandNotFoundError: Your shell has not been properly configured to use 'conda activate'. To initialize your shell, run  $ conda init &lt;SHELL_NAME&gt;              This will have the undesirable side effect of modifying your PATH to include that particular version of miniconda every time you log in (even without loading the miniconda environment variable).              If you accidentally run conda init, edit your shell intereractive startup file ($HOME/.bashrc for the bash shell) and remove all lines between               &gt;&gt;&gt; conda initialize &gt;&gt;&gt;               and               &lt;&lt;&lt; conda initialize &lt;&lt;&lt;                 conda deactivate may still be used safely.              We will continue to monitor the GitHub issue that describes the problem and other workarounds.                        conda activate after source activate                           If conda activate is needed for some advanced use cases like nested (stacked) environments, it can be used after source activate:            [user.name@ceres ~]$ ml miniconda [user.name@ceres ~]$ source activate (base) [user.name@ceres ~]$ conda activate samtools (samtools) [user.name@ceres ~]$                                     Now that you are inside the trinityenv environment, install software into this environment with:(trinityenv) [user.name@ceres ~]$ conda install &lt;package_name&gt; &lt;package_name&gt; &lt;package_name&gt; For example, install the Trinity transcriptome assembler and Kallisto RNA-Seq quantification application (an optional dependency that is not included with the default Trinity 2.8.4 installation). Note this step may take a few minutes:(trinityenv) [user.name@ceres ~]$ conda install trinity kallisto ... Proceed ([y]/n)? y ... Afterwards, the Trinity and Kallisto executables are in your PATH:(trinityenv) [user.name@ceres ~]$ type Trinity Trinity is hashed (/home/user.name/.conda/envs/trinityenv/bin/Trinity)  (trinityenv) [user.name@ceres ~]$ Trinity --version Trinity version: Trinity-v2.8.4-currently using the latest production release of Trinity.  (trinityenv) [user.name@ceres ~]$ type kallisto kallisto is hashed (/home/scinet.username/.conda/envs/trinityenv/bin/kallisto)  (trinityenv) [user.name@ceres ~]$ kallisto version kallisto, version 0.44. To exit the environment:(trinityenv) [user.name@ceres ~]$ conda deactivate [user.name@ceres ~]$  After deactivating the trinityenv environment, Trinity and kallisto are no longer in your PATH:[user.name@ceres ~]$ type Trinity -bash: type: Trinity: not found Example 2: Installing Tensorflow into a /project directoryLoad the latest miniconda module if you haven’t already and create an environment in your /project directory by using the option  --prefix:[user.name@ceres ~]$ module load miniconda [user.name@ceres ~]$ conda create --prefix /project/my_proj/tensorflow ... [user.name@ceres ~]$ source activate /project/my_proj/tensorflow (/project/my_proj/tensorflow) [user.name@ceres ~]$ conda install tensorflow ...  Note: conda first downloads packages into a package cache directory. By default, the package cache is in your home directory  ($HOME/.conda/pkgs). If installing a large amount of software that may cause home directory quota to be exceeded, you can configure another directory to be the package cache by adding a pkgs_dirs list to the $HOME/.condarc file (YAML); e.g.:pkgs_dirs:- /project/my_proj/my_pkg_cacheManaging EnvironmentsSee the official Conda documentation for managing environments for a complete list of commands.To list environments that have been created in your home directory:[user.name@ceres ~]$ conda env list ## conda environments: # trinityenv               /home/user.name/.conda/envs/trinityenv root                  *  /software/7/apps/miniconda/4.7.12 To list software packages in an environment:[user.name@ceres ~]$ conda list --name trinityenv ## packages in environment at /home/user.name/.conda/envs/trinityenv: # ... OR[user.name@ceres ~]$ conda list --prefix /project/my_proj/tensorflow ## packages in environment at /project/my_proj/tensorflow: ... Tip: For reproducibility, a list of all packages/versions in an environment can be exported to an environment file, which can be used to recreate the environment (e.g., by another user, or on another system) or archived with analysis results. This makes it easy for you or anyone else to re-run your analysis on any system and is also a record of the exact software environment you used for your analysis.To remove an environment in your home directory:[user.name@ceres ~]$ conda env remove --name trinityenv To remove an environment in your /project directory:rm -rf /project/my_proj/tensorflow To remove packages not used by any environment, as well as tarballs downloaded into the conda package cache ($HOME/.conda/pkgs):conda clean --all "

  "content" : "This document describes recommended procedures (SOP) for managing data on ARS HPC and storage infrastructure. The key concept is to only use “Tier 1 storage” (that is, storage that is local to a given HPC cluster) as required for actively running compute jobs. Tier 1 storage is not backed up and should not be used for archival purposes. Juno, on the other hand, is periodically backed up to tape and can be used for long-term storage of data and results.  We recommend immediate adoption of the procedures described here for new projects. These procedures should also be followed for “old” projects after first moving extant project data in Tier 1 storage to Juno using one of the procedures described below.  If you would like more detailed information about the data storage options provided by SCINet and how to use them, please see the SCINet Storage Guide. Figure 1. Recommended procedures for managing data on ARS HPC infrastructure using Globus.   Move data to Juno   Copy data to target HPC (Ceres or Atlas)   Run compute tasks   Copy Results to Juno   Copy results to local machine, if desired Definitions   Juno: Large, multi-petabyte ARS storage device at the National Agricultural Library in Maryland, accessed by users; periodically backed up to tape device.  Includes periodic file system snapshots that allow users to recover accidentally deleted files.   Tape backup: Off-site backup of Juno, located at Mississippi State University, accessible by VRSC staff for disaster recovery following major system data loss.   Tier 1 Storage: Storage on either of the HPC clusters, local to computing resources at the National Centers for Animal Health in Ames, Iowa or Mississippi State University. These locations are for storing code, data, and intermediate results while performing a series of computational jobs. This storage is not backed up. Two storage locations are available on each HPC cluster, /project and /90daydata. Historically, space had routinely been allocated in /project, but going forward, space in /project will only be allocated on an as-needed basis. Most users should use /90daydata for routine Tier 1 storage. Detailed instructions, using Globus (preferred)Using Globus is recommended for file transfer performance and reliability. The recommended data management workflow using Globus is illustrated in Figure 1, above.See the SCINet Globus Data Transfer guide for instructions on how to use Globus.   Copy raw data and custom software (e.g., custom scripts, ideally also versioned in Git repositories; conda environments/environment.yml, Singularity image/definition files) from a local workstation or other data source to a project directory on Juno using Globus (search for Globus collection “NAL DTN 0”) (Figure 1.1).  On Juno, the data should be copied to /LTS/project/PROJNAME/.   If not already there, copy data to Tier 1 storage on the cluster you will run on, either Ceres or Atlas, using Globus.  For most projects, you should use /90dayadata for routine, short-term storage (Figure 1.2).  There are no storage quotas on /90daydata, so it is ideal for data-intensive work.  For projects that require longer-term use of Tier 1 storage, space can be requested in /project.  However, please note that no data on Tier 1 storage is backed up.   Use ssh to log in to your chosen HPC cluster (Ceres or Atlas; see Logging in to SCINet); (e.g.:     ssh FIRST.LAST@ceres.scinet.usda.gov          ) and run your compute job (Figure 1.3).      Copy any results you need to keep to Juno so that they are preserved (Figure 1.4).   If desired, you can also copy results to your local workstation (Figure 1.5).  Note that step 1 might not be necessary for all data used for a project. For example, suppose you need to use a large, publicly available satellite-derived dataset for a project. In this case, the data probably do not need to be stored on Juno and can simply be placed directly in /90daydata on Tier 1 storage and deleted when they are no longer needed. Alternative instructions, not using GlobusIt is also possible to move data on SCINet infrastructure using traditional command-line tools like scp and rsync.  See the SCINet File Transfer guide for instructions on how to use these commands to transfer data to/from Ceres and Atlas cluster.To move data to/from Juno, login to ceres-dtn and issue scp or rsync command to nal-dtn, e.g.:ssh ceres-dtn rsync -avz --no-p --no-g ttt nal-dtn.scinet.usda.gov:/LTS/project/&lt;project_name&gt;/ "

  "content" : "Best Practices   Globus Online is the recommended method for transferring data to and from the Ceres cluster. It provides faster data transfer speeds compared to scp, has a graphical interface, and does not require a GA verification code for every file transfer.   Given the space and access limitations of a home directory, large amounts of data or data that will be used collaboratively should be transferred to a project directory. See the User Manual section Quotas on Home and Project Directories for more information on home and project directory quotas.   If you have to transfer very large amounts of data or if network speed at your location is slow, please submit a request to the Virtual Research Support Core (VRSC) to ingress data from a hard drive as described below (section Large Data Transfer by Shipping Hard Drives).   If you have issues with transferring data, please contact the VRSC at scinet_vrsc@USDA.GOV. Globus Data TransferGlobus Online is the recommended method for transferring data to and from the Ceres cluster. It provides faster data transfer speeds compared to scp, has a graphical interface, and does not require a GA verification code for every file transfer. To transfer data to/from a local computer, users will need to install Globus Connect Personal which does NOT require admin privileges.The instructional video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3lnsCAfx3Q demonstrates how to transfer files between local computer, Ceres, Atlas and Juno using Globus.Login   In a browser, navigate to https://www.globus.org/, click ‘Log In’ in the upper right corner.   There are several ways to login to the Globus Web App. Login using one of the available methods:            ORCiD iD login (recommended). You can use your ORCiD, a persistent digital identifier for individual researchers, to sign into Globus (all ARS researchers should have an ORCiD). Click on “Sign in with ORCiD iD” at the bottom of the page. If you don’t yet have an ORCiD, please visit https://orcid.org/ to obtain one.       Globus ID login. You can create an account on Globus ID and use it to log into Globus. See the link to Globus ID under the list of organizational logins.       Organizational login. Many organizations, mostly universities, have organizational logins. ARS currently does not provide an organizational login. If your organization provides an organizational login, select your organization from the list and login with your organization credentials at the familiar login page.       Google account login. Click on “Sign in with Google” at the bottom of the page if you want to use your google account.           You should now be on the Globus ‘File Manager’ page. You should see two panels. If you don’t, click on the 2-panels icon at the top right of the screen. You should now see two panels: Copying Data   The two panes represent the two systems that you want to copy data between. You will need to select a Collection (an Endpoint) for each pane and most likely, authenticate.   Click in the ‘Collection’ box on one of the panes. A selection window will appear. Recent collections will be listed under recent tab. Click on other tabs to see collections that you’ve bookmarked, created or got from other people. In the Recent tab you will also see “Install Globus Connect Personal” button. See below how to install Globus Connect Personal on your computer to transfer data to/from this computer.   If you see your desired collection, click it and continue. If you do not see your desired collection start typing the name in the box at the top. When your collection appears, select it.   If authentication is required for the selected collection, required fields or other instructions will appear.   Type or select “Ceres DTN” for Ceres DTN, “msuhpc2#Atlas-dtn” for Atlas DTN or “NAL DTN 0” for Juno. You will be prompted to login.   Username is your Ceres username. Your password is your Ceres password PLUS the six digits generated by Google Authenticator for access to the Ceres cluster. You would use ‘Password123456’ for the password field where ‘123456’ would be the current code from Google Authenticator and ‘Password’ would be your normal SCINet password.   To transfer data between Ceres and Atlas clusters, log into Ceres DTN in one pane and to Atlas DTN in the other pane. Similarly, to transfer data to/from Juno, log into NAL TN 0 in one of the panels.   Once you have logged in on both panes you will need to navigate to the data you want to copy in one pane (source pane) and navigate to the location you want it copied to on the other pane (destination pane). You can either click on directory names or type the full path in the Path box (under the Collection box).   Before you start your copy, look at the Transfer &amp; Sync Options at the bottom of the page (click on arrow to see available options). To see a short description of each option click on “i” next to the option.   To start the transfer click the blue box with the arrow at the bottom of the page pointing in the direction of the destination pane.   You may now click ‘Activity’ at the left to see a list of current and prior transfers. Click on “File Manager” at the top left of the page to get back to the main page. Globus Connect PersonalTo transfer files to your personal computer you may use Globus Connect Personal. A link “Install Globus Connect Personal” can be found in the Recent tab and in the “More Options” tab in the list of Collections. Click on “Collection” box to get to the list.The installation instructions for Globus Connect Personal are available here:   Windows Install Instructions   Mac Install Instructions   Linux Install Instructions By default, Globus Connect Personal prompts to be installed in C:/Program Files which requires administrator rights. However you don’t need Administrator rights to install Globus Connect Personal on your local machine. If you do not have Administrator rights browse to a place you have write access to (e.g. your Desktop folder) or contact your local IT staff for assistance.Small Data Transfer Using scp and rsyncscp is usually available on any Linux or MacOS machine, and on Microsoft Windows 10 (in PowerShell).  It’s best used when you need to transfer a single file.Below are examples of scp commands to be issued on your local machine. In these examples   &lt;local_path_to_file/&gt; can be omitted, in this case current directory on your local machine will be used   &lt;remote_path_to_file/&gt; can be omitted, in this case home directory on Ceres or Atlas will be used   dest.ext can be omitted, in this case the name of the file being transferred will be used. Transfer To Ceres:scp &lt;local_path_to_file/&gt;file.ext  &lt;SCINetID&gt;@ceres-dtn.scinet.usda.gov:&lt;remote_path_to_file/&gt;dest.ext Transfer To Atlas:scp &lt;local_path_to_file/&gt;file.ext &lt;SCINetID&gt;@atlas-dtn.hpc.msstate.edu:&lt;remote_path_to_file/&gt;dest.ext Transfer From Ceres:scp &lt;SCINetID&gt;@ceres-dtn.scinet.usda.gov:&lt;remote_path_to_file/&gt;file.ext  &lt;local_path_to_file/&gt;dest.ext Transfer From Atlas:scp &lt;SCINetID&gt;@atlas-dtn.hpc.msstate.edu:&lt;remote_path_to_file/&gt;file.ext  &lt;local_path_to_file/&gt;dest.ext It is not advised to use “scp -r” command to transfer directories to Ceres, since the setgid bit on directories at destination is not inherited.  This is not a problem if directories are copied to /home/$USER but is a problem when copying to /project area and usually results in quota exceeded errors.If you decide to use scp to transfer directories to /project, you will have to manually set a setgid bit on the directory and all subdirectories after the transfer using “chmod g+s &lt;dir_name&gt;” command. The following command will set ownership of the files in a directory in /project to the project group and set the setgid bit:find /project/&lt;project_name&gt;/&lt;dir&gt; -exec chgrp proj-&lt;project_name&gt; {} + -a -type d -exec chmod g+s {} +  To learn more about scp command and all available options issue “man scp”.Instead of scp one can use rsync command for bulk transfers. rsync synchronizes files and directories from one location to another while minimizing data transfer as only the outdated or inexistent elements are transferred. It is installed by default on macOS and is available on many Linux hosts. The following command will recursively transfer all new and updated files in the directory &lt;dir_name&gt; on the local machine into directory /project/&lt;project_name&gt;/&lt;dir_name&gt; on Ceres:rsync -avz --no-p --no-g &lt;dir_name&gt; &lt;SCINetID&gt;@ceres-dtn.scinet.usda.gov:/project/&lt;project_name&gt; To learn more about rsync command and all available options issue “man rsync”.Large Data Transfer by Shipping Hard DrivesLarge data transfers will be facilitated by the VRSC and involves users shipping hard disk drives (not thumb drives) with their data on it to the VRSC in Ames, Iowa.  The VRSC will then upload the data directly and put it in a project directory specified by the user.You can send hard drives containing data to the VRSC if you have very large amounts of data (typically greater than 50GB) to transfer to Ceres or if the network speed at your location is slow. Please follow these instructions:        Submit an email request to the VRSC scinet_vrsc@USDA.GOV for a data transfer with the following information:             Amount of data       Target project directory.       Type of filesystem the data is coming from (Window, Mac, Linux)           If you don’t already have a project directory please request one first: Request Project Storage (eAuthentication required)           Copy the data onto a SATA hard drive or SSD             You will be responsible for purchasing your own drive(s)       Any type of hard drive (not a USB drive) is fine but SSDs will be more tolerant of the postal system       Disks must be EXT4, NTFS, HFS, XFS, or FAT formatted                Ship the disk to the following address and email the tracking information to scinet_vrsc@USDA.GOV. Include a print out of your email containing the data transfer request to VRSC in your package. Send to:      Nathan Humeston  74 Durham  613 Morrill Rd  Ames, IA 50011-2100           Once we receive the data we will copy it over to the appropriate project directory and notify you once it is complete.           Please include a prepaid return shipping label so that we can send the drive(s) back to you after the data transfer is complete. Otherwise the drive(s) will not be returned.    Other Ways to Transfer DataOther programs that have a GUI to transfer data and are suitable for smaller file transfers are:        Cyberduck - https://cyberduck.io/           FileZilla - https://filezilla-project.org/    Cyberduck supports multiple protocols (including Amazon S3, iRODS, and Google Drive) and is more secure than FileZilla.FileZillaFilezilla is being made available on SCINet cafe machines. FileZilla uses a dual pane approach to moving files with the left pane being the local system and the right pane being remote. Users will need to setup remote sites using the ‘Site Manager’ found under the File menu.Once in ‘Site Manager’, do the following:   click ‘New Site’   give the site a name   select SFTP protocol   enter a hostname for one of the DTNs   choose Interactive for Logon Type   enter your SCINet username(not an email)   click Connect to test your connection If successful, you should be able to drag and drop files and folders between systems, if permissions and quota allow. You may also right click a file or directory and select Upload or Download depending on which pane you are in.Note for Linux users, external drives are mounted under /run/media/firstname.lastname .Data Transfer to NCBITo transfer data to/from NCBI, ssh to a DTN node and use either ncftp commands (ncftpput, ncftpget) or Aspera command (ascp). Since ftp connections can be unstable we recommend using Aspera for large file transfers.To use Aspera, you will need a private key file that you can acquire by following instructions listed on Page 3 of the document at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK242625"

  "description" : "Using Galaxy",
  "date" : "May 19, 2023",
  "content" : "IntroductionFor support contact: scinet_vrsc@usda.govFirst, a quick note on the terms “Ceres” and “SCINet”: “SCINet” is the network through which you access the high-performance computer named “Ceres”. Generally, we will refer to Ceres accounts in this tutorial because most people think of having an account on a computer, but the account is, more broadly, a network account on SCINet.There are a few compelling reasons why we think you’re going to like using Galaxy on Ceres:   It is a great bioinformatics alternative for those who prefer a graphical user interface.   You don’t have to worry with defining queues and number of nodes in a batch command file. We have tried hard to establish appropriate default parameters to take advantage of Ceres’s parallel processing power.   FTP transfer is tightly integrated in the Ceres Galaxy framework, so file transfer is intuitive, and you don’t run into data limit bottlenecks as quickly.   Galaxy makes it easy to share your analysis with bioinformatic support should the need arise. In addition, you can share with collaborators assuming that they have a Ceres account.   There is plenty of external documentation covering almost all conventional bioinformatic analyses. In fact, many workflows (see below) probably already exist that you can use directly on your data.   If you don’t see a tool in the current interface, it probably is in the Toolshed (see below). You can then request that an administrator install it. In order to use SCINet Galaxy, you need an account on Ceres. Sign up for a SCINet account to start that process. New accounts will automatically get a Galaxy user name and directory. The user name should match the email you used when registering for your Ceres account and the password will match your Ceres password.NOTE: All uploaded and output files are removed after 90 Days so it is recommended users save their data outside of galaxy.Logging OnCeres Galaxy is public facing, so to access it you just type or paste “https://galaxy.scinet.usda.gov” into the address bar of a web browser.  We recommend Firefox, Chrome, or Safari. MAKE SURE TO TYPE THE “https://” prefix and note the “s”.You will be presented with the following login screen, with boxes on the right to enter your username and password:Your user name should match the full email address you used when registering for your Ceres account and the password should match your Ceres password followed by the Google Authenticator code (Example: password123456). After logging in, the standard Galaxy home screen should appear:The “Tools” bar in the left window frame is where you can load, manipulate, and analyze data. The central window frame is where you will see options and parameters programs that you will be running. The right “History” frame shows all the imported files and programs you have run.  In order to begin, you need to upload data. Often data of general interest, such a genome sequences or annotations, are already available in Galaxy under the “Get Data” tab. More commonly, you will be using data that you have generated.You will import files into Galaxy by clicking on the “Tools” sub-heading “Get Data” and then “Upload File” under “Get Data”.  The following download/upload screen should appear:Galaxy offers a method to import data directly from your computer as “Choose local file” button. Feel free to experiment with this direct method, but we find it can be slower and fickler than FTP transfer. To that end, we will mainly focus on uploading files using a file transfer program, such as Globus or Filezilla. If you click on “Choose FTP file”, Galaxy will look in your FTP upload folder on Ceres (/galaxy/upload/ceres_email_ID) for files you have uploaded, so you must first upload your data to that folder.Import data to Ceres GalaxyYou need to move or copy your data files to the Galaxy folder in your home directory on Ceres to make them “visible” to Galaxy. Then, you will be able to upload/import the files using Galaxy. Remember, the default quota in SCINet galaxy is only 100 GB. Please contact us to increase your default quota.We recommend using Globus to move files to your Galaxy folder on Ceres. For instructions please see the Transferring Files Guide.NOTE: If you already have data on Ceres, simply copy files into your Galaxy folder on Ceres either via command-line (cp command) or by using a Filezilla-like tool. These files will appear as if you had uploaded them via FTP and can be imported using the approach described below.IMPORTANT NOTE: Make sure when transfering files to consider how the files are being transfered, i.e. using cp  or mv. Moving (mv) instead of copying(cp) will REMOVE  the original files so it is recommended to use cp  or review how you want your files to be handled before moving.Once your data files are in your Galaxy folder in your home directory on Ceres, go back to the “Upload File” screen and click “Choose FTP site”. You will see the download/upload screen with a list of your files:Select the file you want to import and hit “Start”.NOTE: Importing the data into galaxy will REMOVE  the file that you moved via FTP. NOTE: Uploading directly from disk is slower than the other methods of tranfering.You can close this window and the file will appear in the History pane on the right of your home screen:This is a generic way to import files and can be used regardless of file format.  You are now ready to process your data.Using GalaxyWe have tried to focus on aspects of using Galaxy that are specific to USDA-ARS’s Ceres installation. There are hundreds of tutorials and videos to introduce you to the Galaxy framework, which is essentially the same no matter where it is installed. We suggest that you start at https://galaxyproject.org/learn/. A nice interactive introduction is also available at Help &gt; Interactive Tours, or https://galaxy.scinet.usda.gov/tours.A common initial hang-up is getting your uploaded data in the right format. For sequencing data, you usually need to make clear what quality-scale you are using. For illumina reads, review the following link: https://galaxyproject.org/support/fastqsanger/. In addition, it is common for sample data from sequencing centers to be spread across multiple lanes. If you only have a few samples, you can concatenate these in Galaxy using Concatenate – Text Manipulation tool. If you have many samples, it will probably be best to concatenate those files prior to uploading using the commandline function cat.For example, for files ‘samp1_L1_R1.fq’, ‘samp1_L2_R1.fq’ use[jane.user@sn-cn-18-0 ~]$ cat *R1.fq &gt;sample1_R1.fq Also note, .gz compressed files can be concatenated using the same approach without having to uncompress them first.You will usually want to structure your data into Collections for batch processing and downstream analysis. See https://galaxyproject.org/tutorials/collections/ or, for a worked example, https://depot.galaxyproject.org/hub/attachments/documents/presentations/gcc2014/Chilton.pdf. Alternatively, most tools will allow you to run the same process on multiple datasets of the same format without combining them as Collections.Some links to common analyses are given below. Many of these analyses already exist as published workflows and can be used directly. See https://usegalaxy.org/workflow/list_published for a searchable list. To use, download the workflow of interest, click on the “Workflow” tab at the top of your main screen, and then import the workflow according to the instructions. An example of usage is available here: http://sepsis-omics.github.io/tutorials/modules/workflows/. For those wanting to develop their own worflows, a graphic editor is available, as described here: https://galaxyproject.org/tutorials/g101/#opening-workflow-editor.RNA-seq – general overview (https://galaxyproject.org/tutorials/rb_rnaseq/) and galaxy specific pipeline (https://galaxyproject.org/tutorials/nt_rnaseq). Also check out https://sites.google.com/site/princetonhtseq/tutorials/rna-seq.SNP-calling – https://galaxyproject.org/tutorials/var_dip/ for diploid genomes and https://galaxyproject.org/tutorials/var_hap/ for haploid genomes.IMPORTANT: If you receive the job error “This job was terminated because it ran longer than the maximum allowed job run time” it means that the tool has not been appropriately configured to run on Ceres using the scale of data that you have provided. Please contact scinet_vrsc@usda.gov and we can optimize these parameters for you and for future users.Sharing Your Data and AnalysisIf you need some consultation on your results or on parameter settings, it can be very useful to share your analysis with someone so that you can both be viewing the same thing. To that end, we will give this aspect special emphasis. You can see a short introduction to this option at https://galaxyproject.org/learn/share.Briefly, if you are in the appropriate history, follow the clicks on the History pane indicated in red (select Settings gear icon, then select “Share or Publish” on the settings menu):You will see the “Share or Publsish History Galaxy_Walkthru” screem:You can manually enter the user name you wish to share with in the drop-down space. Be careful that the user-name is exact and appropriate capitalization is observed.After you have gone through these steps, the person you have shared your history with will need to go to the same gear icon used above but instead click on “Histories Shared With Me”. The shared history should be present on the resultant interface.Can’t Find a Tool You Need?We have loaded a core subset of all tools that are available on the public Galaxy server (https://usegalaxy.org). If you do not see a tool you need and cannot use a good alternative, you should search in the Toolshed (https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu). After identifying the relevant tool, email a Ceres Galaxy administrator: scinet_vrsc@usda.gov. If there are multiple options, we encourage the use of tools developed by either “devteam” or “iuc”. Depending on the nature of the tool you are requesting, we may ask you to supply a sample dataset for testing purposes, so anticipate having that data available.Additionally, there is an option for galaxy install as well on the application to request software installation by the VRSC. Select the Galaxy checkbox in the “Type of Application” section:"

  "content" : "The software discussed and shown in these user guides is largely open source, can run on a desktop, HPC, or cloud environment, and can be installed with software management systems that support reproducibility (such as Conda, Singularity, and Docker). Below is a quick overview of some of the software, hardware, and confusing nomenclature that is used throughout this site.SCINet vs. Ceres vs. AtlasSCINet is the USDA ARS Scientific Computing INitiative that aims to improve access to high performance and cloud computing, improve networking to facilitate high speed data transfer, and facilitate scientific computational training. The Virtual Research Support Core (VRSC)Ceres is one of the HPC systems (located in Iowa) connected to the SCINet infrastucture. The system is largely maintained by staff at Iowa State University.Atlas is the more recently added HPC systemFor more information on the HPC systems that SCINet offers, see the Computer Systems page.Open OnDemandJupyter is an open-source, non-profit project to support interactive data science and scientific computing. Jupyter is language agnostic with support for &gt;130 different scientific programing language kernels. This workshop will use the following two applications from the Jupyter software stack:   Open OnDemand: A software to serve JupyterLab to multiple users (this is how we will launch an instance of JupyterLab on Ceres without having to to SSH into the cluster). Documention at: https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/   JupyterLab: A web-based interactive development environment. Documentation at: https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ SLURMSLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) is the workload manager used on the Ceres and Atlas HPC system to allocate computational resources. From the SLURM documentation, SLURM is “an open source… cluster management and job scheduling system for large and small Linux clusters. As a cluster workload manager, SLURM has three key functions. First, it allocates exclusive and/or non-exclusive access to resources (compute nodes) to users for some duration of time so they can perform work. Second, it provides a framework for starting, executing, and monitoring work (normally a parallel job) on the set of allocated nodes. Finally, it arbitrates contention for resources by managing a queue of pending work.”Scientific Coding Languages - Python and RPython and R appear to be the most common scientific programming languages used across ARS. However, many of these examples could also be run in other programming languages such as Julia, Go, IDL/ENVI, etc."

If you have not, please email the Virtual Research Support Core at scinet_vrsc@USDA.GOV.Before accessing various SCINet resources, new users need to ssh either to Ceres or Atlas cluster and change the temporary password. Note that home directories on Atlas are not created right away, so it is recommended to wait a day after receiving email with the credentials before logging to Atlas cluster.Using ssh to ConnectFrom Windows 10Windows 10 that is up to date has an ssh client in the Windows Power Shell. To use that client, click on the Start button and start typing “power”. Select Windows PowerShell from the list.In the PowerShell window, you can type one of two options:1) ssh user.name@ceres.scinet.usda.gov (for Ceres Connections) 2) ssh user.name@atlas-login.hpc.msstate.edu (for Atlas Connections) NOTE: Be sure to replace “user.name” in both options above with your assigned username.It is also recommended to create a config file on your computer. You may do so using Notepad.  The file you create must be titled “config” with no extension for this method to work properly (i.e. “config” not “config.txt”).  Note: Do not copy the code into the terminal itself, it must be in a separate file.Create a ~/.ssh/config file replacing USER.NAME with your actual username, all in lowercase.  To save this config file to your .ssh folder, you must save it to your user folder.  The path to the .ssh file is as follows: C&gt;Users&gt;(Your Account)&gt;.sshHost ceres-login HostName ceres.scinet.usda.gov User USER.NAME TCPKeepAlive yes ServerAliveInterval 20 ServerAliveCountMax 30  Host atlas-login HostName atlas-login.hpc.msstate.edu User USER.NAME TCPKeepAlive yes ServerAliveInterval 20 ServerAliveCountMax 30 If you don’t want to use the config file method above, add the following title to the ssh command replacing USER.NAME with your actual username, all in lowercase.ssh -o TCPKeepAlive=yes -o ServerAliveInterval=20 -o ServerAliveCountMax=30 USER.NAME@ceres.scinet.usda.gov andssh -o TCPKeepAlive=yes -o ServerAliveInterval=20 -o ServerAliveCountMax=30 USER.NAME@atlas-login.hpc.msstate.edu After you have followed either of the options above, enter the 6-digit “Verification Code” generated by the Google Authenticator app when prompted. Note that the code and your password will not be visible on the screen when typed. If the code is correct, the system will then prompt you for your password.Please Note: If you are connected to the SCINet VPN, you will not be prompted to enter the Google Authenticator Code. If you make a mistake entering the code, you will be prompted to enter the verification code once more, but you must wait for a new code to be generated.If your password has expired (new temporary passwords expire right away, and the passwords set by users expire after 60 days) you will be prompted to change your password. To paste from a clipboard into PowerShell, perform single right click with the mouse and then press Enter. Please see below for a detailed guide on changing your password.When Changing Your Temporary Password (Mandatory Prompt When First Connecting):   Enter either of the following:  A. $ ssh user.name@ceres.scinet.usda.gov  B. ssh user.name@atlas-login.hpc.msstate.edu   Enter the 6-digit verification code generated by the Google Authenticator app when prompted.   Enter your temporary password found in your welcome email when prompted for the password.   When prompted for your “Current Password”, re-enter your temporary password.   Enter your “new password” twice when prompted.   Note: The new password requirements are listed below the Mac and Linux instructions. After updating your password, you will be prompted to answer Yes or No to entering a cell phone. It is strongly recommended to add a cell phone just in case you need to reset your Google Authenticator in the future. Enter “y” and then enter your cellphone number with no dashes or parenthesis, as shown in the image below.From Older Windows VersionsTo begin, download Putty.exe.  Once downloaded, start PuTTY and use the following instructions:   In the left-hand menu select the ‘Session’ category, then on the right side type into the ‘Host Name’ either ceres.scinet.usda.gov (for Ceres connections) or atlas-login.hpc.msstate.edu (for Atlas connections).   In the left-hand menu select the ‘Connection’ category, then on the right side replace 0 with 60 for “Seconds between keepalives” and check the “Enable TCP keepalives”   In the left-hand menu select “Data” category under the ‘Connection’ category and type your username on the right side   To save these settings for later logins select the ‘Session’ category, and in the “Saved Sessions” type SCINet Ceres or SCINet Atlas, then click on “Save” button.   Hit “Open”   Enter the 6-digit verification code generated by the Google Authenticator app when prompted. Note that when you type the code or the password, nothing will be shown on the screen. If you made a mistake when typing 6-digit code, you will be prompted for Verification code once again, but you must wait for the new code to be generated before entering the code again.  If system accepts the code it will prompt you for current password. If you are logging in for the first time, enter your temporary password provided in your welcome email. If you are changing your password, you may enter your current password. To paste from a clipboard into Putty, perform single right click with the mouse and then press Enter. (However, this form of copy and paste may no longer be functional)  Note: The new password requirements are listed below the Mac and Linux instructions. From Mac and LinuxOpen a terminal window. We recommend setting up a config file to make logging in easier and use settings to provide a more stable connection.  This can be done by creating a config file u sing the following code and then saving it to your .ssh file.  The file you create must be titled “config” for this method to work properly.  Note: Do not copy the code into the terminal itself, it must be a separate file on your computer.Create a ~/.ssh/config entry similar to this, replacing USER.NAME with your actual username, all in lowercase:Host ceres-login HostName ceres.scinet.usda.gov User USER.NAME TCPKeepAlive yes ServerAliveInterval 20 ServerAliveCountMax 30  Host atlas-login HostName atlas-login.hpc.msstate.edu User USER.NAME TCPKeepAlive yes ServerAliveInterval 20 ServerAliveCountMax 30 Note: To save this config file to your .ssh folder, you must save it to your user folder. However, the .ssh file is currently hidden to you. To reveal the hidden files, you will press and hold CMD + SHIFT + . (Period Key) when choosing a location to save your file. The .ssh file will now be visible for you to save the config file.That will send a “keepalive” signal every 20 seconds and keep retrying for up to 30 failures. This also simplifies your login to just:ssh ceres-login or ssh atlas-loginIf you don’t want to use the config file method above, add the following title to the ssh command replacing USER.NAME with your actual username in lowercase.ssh -o TCPKeepAlive=yes -o ServerAliveInterval=20 -o ServerAliveCountMax=30 USER.NAME@ceres.scinet.usda.gov andssh -o TCPKeepAlive=yes -o ServerAliveInterval=20 -o ServerAliveCountMax=30 USER.NAME@atlas-login.hpc.msstate.edu After typing ssh command, enter the 6-digit code verification code generated by the Google Authenticator app when prompted for the Verification Code. Note that when you type the code or the password, nothing will be shown on the screen. If system accepts the code it will prompt you for password.Please Note: If you are connected to the SCINet VPN, you will not be prompted to enter the Google Authenticator Code. If you make a mistake entering the code, you will be prompted to enter the verification code once more, but you must wait for a new code to be generated.When Changing your Password (Mandatory Prompt when First Connecting):   Enter either of the following: $ ssh user.name@ceres.scinet.usda.gov OR ssh user.name@atlas-login.hpc.msstate.edu   Enter the 6-digit verification code generated by the Google Authenticator app when prompted.

It is strongly recommended to add a cell phone just in case you need to reset your Google Authenticator in the future. Enter “y” and then enter your cellphone number with no dashes or parenthesis, as shown in the image below.Password Requirements   AT LEAST 14 characters long   Your last 24 passwords cannot be reused. Frequently Asked QuestionsIt didn’t ask me for the Verification Code from Google Authenticator. What do I do?  If you are connected to the VPN, the code will be waived, no need to worry about entering it.I can’t find the .ssh folder when saving my config file. Where is it located?   The .ssh file is usually hidden to you.  You must show all hidden files when saving your file before you will be able to save to the .ssh file.My password/Google Authenticator Verification Code isn’t showing up when I type it. What is wrong?   There is nothing wrong with your terminal, the password and GA Verification Code will never show when you type. That is why it is important to be careful when entering the information. For passwords, copy + paste are extremely helpful to avoid mistakes.After creating my account and changing my temporary password, I was prompted for my cell phone. Should I include this?   It is highly recommended to include your cell phone when setting up your account.  This will be used if you need to perform a self-reset on your Google Authenticator code.  Without the cell phone in your account, you may need to reapply for a SCINet account."

  "description" : "A guide to setting up multifactor authentication for SCINet",
  "date" : "May 19, 2023",
  "content" : "What is Multifactor AuthenticationFederal computer systems are required to use multifactor authentication for site security. This means that a code is required in addition to a password to login to SCINet. If you’re ssh-ing to Ceres cluster from a connected site (where you already had to use second factor such as PIV/CAC), you probably won’t be prompted for a verification code. However the code is always required to ssh to the Atlas cluster and to use other SCINet resources, such as SCINet Galaxy or SCINet Forum. It’s also needed to connect to SCINet VPN.You will need to install an app on a mobile device or a small program on your computer that will generate your verification codes. The app is initialized with your SCINet Google Authentication (GA) account, that is normally created along with your SCINet account.To add your SCINet GA account to the app, you will need a key or a QR code, that you can find in your “Welcome to SCINet” email.Note: If your SCINet account was created before January 2020, and a GA account was never created, attempt to login to the Ceres DTN node:ssh &lt;your SCINet username&gt;@ceres-dtn-0.scinet.usda.gov At the first attempt a GA account will be created for you and you will receive an email containing a key/code that should be used to initialize GA on your mobile device.If you have already had GA installed and initialized but now need to either re-install GA or install it on a new device, and if you saved your SMS phone number in the system, you can reset GA account by going to https://ga.scinet.usda.gov/reset. After resetting your GA account you will receive an email containing a key/code that should be used to initialize GA on your mobile device.Follow the instructions below to set up multifactor authentication on either your mobile Android device (recommended), Apple device (recommended), or on your computer.Google Authenticator (GA) on AndroidRequirementsTo use Google Authenticator on your Android device, it must be running Android version 2.1 or later (other TOTP authenticators can be used if you prefer).Downloading the app   Visit Google Play.   Search for Google Authenticator.   Download and install the application. Setting up the appOpen the Google authenticator app on your mobile device.If this is the first time you have used Authenticator, click the Add an account button. If you already use the app and are adding a new account, choose “Add an account” from the app’s menu.There are two ways to link your device to your account. Using QR code is easier but requires a barcode scanner which you can install if you don’t have it yet (Google Authenticator app will prompt you to install it). An alternative would be to use a Google Authenticator key as mentioned on the above screenshot.Link phone using QR codeSelect Scan a barcode. If the Authenticator app cannot locate a barcode scanner app on your phone, you might be prompted to download and install one. If you want to install a barcode scanner app so you can complete the setup process, press Install then go through the installation process. Once the app is installed, reopen Google Authenticator, display QR code on your computer by clicking on the link in the “Welcome to SCINet” email and point your camera at the QR code.Link phone manually with a GA keySelect Enter a provided key, then Enter account name, which is &lt;your SCINet username&gt;@ceres. Next, enter the Google Authenticator key from the “Welcome to SCINet” email into the box under Enter Key. Make sure you’ve chosen to make the key time-based and press “Save.”VerifyTo verify the application is working correctly,ssh &lt;your SCINet username&gt;@ceres-dtn-0.scinet.usda.gov Enter the verification code currently displayed in Google Authenticator, then enter your SCINet password.If your code is correct, you will be connected to Ceres’ data transfer node. If your code is incorrect and you’re prompted for a verification code again, wait for a new code to be generated on your phone, then enter it on your computer. If you’re still having trouble, verify that the time on your phone is correct.After logging in the first time you will be prompted to save an SMS phone number in the system so an SMS message can be sent to you when a GA account reset is requested.Contact scinet_vrsc@usda.gov if you need assistance.Google Authenticator (GA) on Apple iOS iPhones and iPadsRequirementsTo use Google Authenticator on your iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad, you must have iOS 5.0 or later. In addition, in order to set up the app on your iPhone using a QR code, you must have a 3G model or later.Downloading the app   Visit the App Store.   Search for Google Authenticator.   Download and install the application. Setting up the appOn your iOS device, open the Google Authenticator application. Tap the plus icon. Tap “Time Based” (label 1).There are two ways to link your device to your account. Using a QR code is easier but requires a camera. An alternative would be to use a Google Authenticator key in the Key field (label 2c in above screenshot).Link phone using QR codeTap “Scan Barcode” (label 2a above) and then point your camera at the QR code on your computer screen (click on the link in the “Welcome to SCINet” email to access QR code).Link phone manually with a GA keyIn the box next to Account (label 2b above), enter your account name, which is &lt;your SCINet username&gt;@ceres . Then, enter the Google Authenticator key from the “Welcome to SCINet” email into the box next to “Key” (label 2c above) and tap “Done” (label 2d above).VerifyTo verify the application is working correctly,ssh &lt;your SCINet username&gt;@ceres-dtn-0.scinet.usda.gov Enter the verification code currently displayed in google authenticator and then enter your password.If your code is correct, you will be connected to Ceres’ data transfer node. If your code is incorrect and you’re prompted for a verification code again, wait for a new code to be generated on your phone, then enter it on your computer. If you’re still having trouble, verify that the time on your phone is correct.After logging in the first time you will be prompted to save an SMS phone number in the system so an SMS message can be sent to you when a GA account reset is requested.Contact scinet_vrsc@usda.gov if you need assistance.Authentication on your computer using AuthyIf you are unable to use a smart device for multifactor authentication you may use Authy on your PC for a second factor.Authy can be downloaded from https://authy.com.Click the download button then scroll down to the “Desktop” section and download the binary for your platform. (Windows or macOS)Run the installer. This won’t require administrator privileges, but it will need to be run by each user of the machine.The installer will need to tie your login to a phone number and an email address. The phone number can be either a land line or a cell phone.The systems will want to send you a verification number. If you are not using a cell phone please select “voice call” (not SMS) for the verification.After making your choice a code will be shown and you should receive a call or a text which you should respond to with the code on your screen.You are now setup and can add your SCINet GA key to Authy.To do so click the red “+” in the Authy app and enter the key from the email you received titled “Welcome to SCINet”.You will need to enter the key from the email since Authy cannot use QR codes.Now name the account and pick an icon.Authy should now be displaying codes for use with Ceres. Each code is shown for 30 seconds and then a new code in generated automatically. Codes are only valid for a few seconds after they are displayed and cannot be reused.Contact scinet_vrsc@usda.gov if you need assistance.GA account resetUsers may need to reset GA accounts when switching or reinstalling their mobile devices that have GA application installed. To be able to perform GA reset by yourself, save an SMS phone number in the system by issuing phone-collect.sh command on Ceres. This is the same process that is run automatically the first time you login. After doing that you will be able to do a self-service reset of your GA at https://ga.scinet.usda.gov/reset/.If you are unable to or do not wish to save an SMS phone number, GA account reset request will have to go though your supervisor or sponsor as we have no way of directly verifying your identity."

To see the path to the loaded software and the version type$ which blastp which should display something like:/software/7/apps/blast+/2.9.0/bin/blastp If you want to load legacy NCBI-BLAST on Ceres, follow the example below:$ module load blast $ which blastall should display something like/software/7/apps/blast/2.2.26/bin/blastall If you would like to find out more about a particular software module, you can use the  module help  command, e.g.$ module help blast will output basic information about the blast package, including an URL to the package website.Loading and Unloading ModulesYou must remove some modules before loading others, to switch versions or dependencies.For example, if you have already loaded a blast+ module using the “module load blast+” command to use latest version of NCBI-BLAST, but later you want to load a previous version of blast+ (2.2.30), then follow the steps below:$ module swap blast+ blast+/2.2.31 or:$ module unload blast+ $ module load blast+/2.2.31 $ which blastp The last command should display/software/7/apps/blast+/2.2.31/bin/blastp Another example. If you want to compile parallel C, C++, or Fortran code and wanted to use OpenMPI instead of MPICH which is currently loaded in your environment, you can use  module swap  or  module unload:$ module swap mpich openmpi or:$ module unload mpich $ module load openmpi Some modules depend on other modules, so additional modules may be loaded or unloaded with one module command. For example, BEAST requires a Java module, so loading the “beast” module automatically loads the correct Java version:$ module load beast $ which java should display something like:/software/7/apps/java/1.8.0_121/bin/java If you find yourself regularly using a set of module commands, you may want to add these to your configuration files (.bashrc for Bash users, .cshrc for C shell users).Module: command not foundThe error message module: command not found is sometimes encountered when switching from one shell to another or attempting to run the module command from within a shell script or batch job. The reason that the module command may not be inherited as expected is that it is defined as a function for your login shell. If you encounter this error execute the following from the command line (interactive shells) or add to your shell script:$ source /etc/profile.d/modules.sh "

Often times installing the software you need is as easy as typingconda create --name my_environment my_program Thousands of biological packages and their dependencies can be installed with a single command using the Bioconda repository for the Conda package manager. You can also install a package directly from Github or elsewhere and compile it yourself. For more on installing Conda see User-installed Software on Ceres with Conda.You can also install and or compile software manually in your  $HOME  or  $PROJECT  directories. This is the fastest and easiest way to get your software.Option 2: Request a new module be installedIf you need software that you think will be useful to many SCINet users you can request that the software be installed as a module. Doing this requires an agency-level security review and takes a few weeks. Modules can be requested with the Software request form (eAuthentication required, non-ARS users should contact their sponsor).Ceres Command-line Software Managed by the Module System"

  "content" : "Each file on a Linux system is associated with one user and one group. On Ceres, files in a user’s home directory by default are associated with the user’s primary group, which has the same name as user’s SCINet account. Files in the project directories by default are associated with the project groups. Group quotas that control the amount of data stored are enabled on both home and project directories.At login, current usage and quotas are displayed for all groups that a user belongs to. The my_quotas command provides the same output:$ my_quotas If users need more storage than what is available in the home directory, they should visit the Request a Project Storage page. Several users may work on the same project and share the same project directory.Project directories are located in the 2.3PB Lustre space that is mounted on all nodes as /lustre/project and is also accessible as /project. Directories in /project are not backed up. It is not recommended to run jobs from a directory in /KEEP.Since on Ceres usage and quotas are based on groups, it’s important to have files in the home directories to be associated with the users’ primary groups, and files in the project directories to be associated with project groups. Sometimes it may happen that files that were originally located in a home directory, were later moved to a project directory with the group ownership preserved. In this case even though files will be located in a project directory, they still will count against home directory quota. To fix this, change the group ownership of these files to the project directory group. The following command will change group association of all files in a directory within the project directory in /project as well as set the setgid bit (it may take a while if there are too many files in the directory):$ find /project/&lt;project_name&gt;/&lt;dir&gt; -exec chgrp proj-&lt;project_name&gt; {} + -a -type d -exec chmod g+s {} +  To search for files owned by your primary group in a project directory, issue:$ find /project/&lt;project_directory_name&gt; -group &lt;SCINet UserID&gt; -type f For more information about storage options, refer to SCINet Storage Guide.Local Sharing of Files with Other UsersUsers who would like to share files with other users can use /90daydata/shared directory. Files older than 90 days will be automatically deleted.NOTE: Files in /90daydata/shared folder by default are accessible to everybody on the system. Thus, this mechanism for sharing should only be used for files of a non-confidential nature."

  "description" : "Installing R, Python, and Perl packages",
  "date" : "May 19, 2023",
  "content" : "The popular R, Perl and Python languages have many packages/modules available. Some of the packages are installed on Ceres and are available with the r/perl/python_2/python_3 modules. To see the list of installed packages, visit the Preinstalled Software List page or use  module help &lt;module_name&gt;  command. If users need packages that are not available, they can either request VRSC to add packages, or they can download and install packages in their home/project directories. We recommend installing packages in the project directories since collaborators on the same project most probably would need same packages. In addition, home quotas are much lower than quotas for project directories. The following instructions are for a few commonly used software packages to help users install these packages without admin intervention.Installing R PackagesUsers can install R packages using the  install.packages()  command.The default location is the user’s home directory. User can specify other directories to which they have access privileges, such as project directory. Installing R packages in a project directory is recommended as users working on the same project have access to the same environment.To install packages in a project directory, go to the project directory:cd &lt;path/to/the/project/directory&gt; and create a “.Renviron” file containing the following line:R_LIBS_USER=&lt;path/to/the/project/directory&gt;/R_packages/%vThen when R is started from the directory &lt;path/to/the/project/directory&gt;, the R packages for the given version of R will be saved in the above location.Load an environment module for the desired version of R and start R:$ module load r/4.0.3 $ R R version 4.0.3 (2020-10-10) -- Bunny-Wunnies Freak Out To install A3 package issue the  install.packages()  command and answer “y” to both questions:&gt; install.packages(A3,repos=http://cran.r-project.org) Warning in install.packages(A3) : 'lib = /lustre/project/software/7/apps/r/4.0.3/lib64/R/library' is not writable Would you like to use a personal library instead? (yes/No/cancel) yes Would you like to create a personal library &lt;path/to/the/project/directory&gt;/R_packages/4.0 to install packages into? (yes/No/cancel) yes To see the library paths, issue  .libPaths()  command from within R:&gt; .libPaths(); [1] &lt;path/to/the/project/directory&gt;/R_packages/4.0 [2] /lustre/project/software/7/apps/r/4.0.3/lib64/R/library PythonUsers can install python packages(via pip) to their home directory. This creates a “site-packages” directory within the user’s home directory.$ module load python_3 $ pip3 install --user &lt;package.name&gt; By default the packages for python 3.5 are stored in ~/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packagesIf users intend to share the python environment with users working on the same project (or to install packages in a non-standard location), using virtualenv is a much better way to deal with managing python packages.After loading the python module, create a virtual environment by:$ virtualenv &lt;path/to/the/project/directory/name.of.the.project&gt; This creates a directory in your current project directory. This example below shows a virtualenv “virt_test” being created and activated.$ virtualenv virt_test Using base prefix '/software/apps/python_3/gcc/64/3.5.0' New python executable in /root/virt_test/bin/python3.5 Also creating executable in /root/virt_test/bin/python Installing setuptools, pip, wheel...done. $ source virt_test/bin/activate $ source virt_test/bin/activate (virt_test) $ pip3 list pip (9.0.1) setuptools (36.0.1) wheel (0.29.0) Note that this virtual environment starts clean without using any global python site-packages that are already installed. Use  --system-site-packages  if you want to use global site-packages.To exit this environment, run deactivate:(virt_test) $ deactivate This virtual environment can be activated again anytime.For instructions on how to manage Python packages using Conda, see User-installed Software on Ceres with Conda.PerlThere are multiple ways to install modules in Perl and depending on the use case, one may be preferable over the others.cpanm is a convenient tool to install modules in the home directory.$ module load perl $ cpanm Test::More Running the above command creates a “perl5” directory within the users’ home directory and contains all the required binaries and libraries associated with the “Test::More” module. Add PERL5LIB to the environment$ export PERL5LIB=$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5:$PERL5LIB Perl modules can also be installed in other directories. For example, the user can have the modules available to the rest of the project members so that everyone involved works in the same environment.local::lib provides the flexibility for users to install modules in any custom location (as long as they have write permissions).$ eval $(perl -I/path/to/the/project/dir/perl5/lib/perl5 - Mlocal::lib=/path/to/the/project/dir/perl5) In addition to creating “perl5” directory within the specified project directory, the above command adds perl local::lib environment variables.Then use cpanm to install the required modules.$ cpanm Test::More Note: The package source files will still be downloaded to your home directory (~/.cpanm/sources)Note: All users working on the project can access modules that were installed using local:lib and perlbrew, but only the original user can perform perl module installs.perlbrew is another tool that can create perl environments. perlbrew offers a lot of flexibility to users as they can install different versions of perl based on the requirements of the project.$ module load perl $ perlbrew availableperl-5.27.1 perl-5.26.0 perl-5.24.1 ...... Set the PERLBREW_ROOT variable to a preferred location.$ export PERLBREW_ROOT=/path/to/project/dir/perlbrew $ perlbew init To install the latest stable release$ perlbrew --notest install stable To install a specific version of perl$ perlbrew --notest install perl-5.24.0 $ perlbrew list perl-5.26.0 perl-5.24.0 To use the latest perl,$ perlbrew use 5.26.0 Users can then use cpanm to install modules based on their requirements.It is also possible to switch between different perl installs(if you have them installed)$ perlbrew switch 5.24.0 This switches from 5.26.0 to 5.24.0Note: All users working on the project can access modules that were installed using local:lib and perlbrew, but only the original user can perform perl module installs."

  "description" : "Using Rstudio",
  "date" : "May 19, 2023",
  "content" : "RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for the R programming language, with limited support for other programming languages (including Python, bash, and SQL). RStudio provides a powerful graphical environment for importing data in a number of formats (including CSV, Excel spreadsheets, SAS, and SPSS); manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing data; version control with git or SVN; a graphical R package manager that provides point/click search/installation/uninstallation of R packages from its substantial ecosystem (including the Bioconductor repository, which provides almost 1500 software tools “for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data.”); and many other features.RStudio Server is a client/server version of RStudio that runs on a remote server and is accessed via the client’s web browser. A graphical file manager allows file upload/download from Ceres via web browser.SCINet Options for RStudioSCINet users can use RStudio in one of the following ways:   To run RStudio and access data on your local workstation, download the open source RStudio Desktop.   To run an RStudio Server virtual machine on and access data in Amazon Web Services, contact the SCINet VRSC.   NEW: RStudio Server on Ceres in Open OnDemand.   RStudio Server on Ceres through SCINet VPN or via ssh-tunnel. RStudio Server on CeresRStudio Server is currently available on Ceres using a Docker image (imported into Singularity) provided by the Rocker project. The provided geospatial image provides not only geospatial libraries, but also LaTeX / publishing libraries, and Tidyverse data science libraries. Other R packages can be easily installed into your home directory from within RStudio.Running RStudio Server on Ceres allows SCINet users to access any data on Ceres that they can access from the command line (SSH).Users can either run RStudio Server in Open OnDemand or by manually submiting a SLURM job script and connecting to the server through SCINet VPN or via ssh-tunnel. The first method (via Open OnDemand) is much easier-to-use and is recommended over the second method.A few Ceres-specific notes:   RStudio terminal (bash command shell): since RStudio Server is running in a container with a Debian base image, you won’t be able to access software environment modules (e.g., that you would normally see when logging into Ceres and issuing the  module list  command), as those are installed on the (CentOS) host.   Data access: your home directory is mounted inside the RStudio Server container, and the VRSC has configured Singularity to mount the /project directory.  $TMPDIR (which on a compute node is per-job local scratch on the compute node’s direct attached storage that gets deleted at the end of SLURM job) is mounted inside the container at /tmp.   Software installation: The provided SLURM job script creates a ~/.Renviron file in your home directory that allows RStudio to install additional R packages into your home directory (the container image is immutable). Installing a lot of R libraries may contribute to the default 5G soft limit quota on your home directory being surpassed. To overcome this issue you can move R directory from your home directory to your project directory and create a symbolic link to the new location. In RStudio click on “Terminal” and enter the following commands substituting your values: cd mkdir /project/&lt;your_project_dir&gt;/&lt;account_name&gt; mv R /project/&lt;your_project_dir&gt;/&lt;account_name&gt;/ chgrp -R proj-&lt;your_project_dir&gt; /project/&lt;your_project_dir&gt;/&lt;account_name&gt;/R chmod -R g+s /project/&lt;your_project_dir&gt;/&lt;account_name&gt;/R ln -s /project/&lt;your_project_dir&gt;/&lt;account_name&gt;/R R The mv and chgrp commands may take longer time depending on how much data you have in the R directory. You will need to restart R for this new location to take effect. In the “console” window type quit() and click on “Start New Session”.   Default working directory: By default RStudio sets working directory to your home directory. You can change the default by clicking on Tools -&gt; Global Options… In the General tab click on Browse, then on the three dots on the right and enter path to the folder, e.g. /project/. You can then navigate further to a subdirectory. When done click on Choose button, and then on OK. This will be the default working directory that will show in the panel on the right next time you start RStudio or restart R in the RStudio. RStudio Server in Open OnDemandIn your browser go to https://ceres-ood.scinet.usda.gov/, enter your SCINet user name and SCINet password, followed by the GA code. See MFA Guide for more information about GA codes.After logging into Open OnDemand, click on “Interactive Apps” in the menu on the top and select “RStudio Server: Ceres”.Modify default values if needed and click on the “Launch” button at the bottom of the page. It may take up to several minutes for the new session to start. Once it starts a new button “Connect to RStudio Server” will appear. Clicking on the button will open RStudio IDE in a new browser tab. When done using RStudio, return to the previous tab to stop the RStudio session by clicking on the red “Delete” button.Note that while the RStudio session is running you can connect and disconnect to/from the RStudio Server multiple times. Every click on the “Connect to RStudio Server” button will open a new browser tab.Also note that once you click on the “Launch” button and a new session starts, requested resources will be allocated to your job and won’t be available to other users even if you don’t run anything in the RStudio. Please be considerate, request only resources that you need for your tasks and remember to delete the session when done.For tips and tricks refer to the previous section and to the RStudio Tutorial at https://www.dataquest.io/blog/tutorial-getting-started-with-r-and-rstudio/#tve-jump-173bb2584fe.RStudio Server through VPN or ssh tunnelTo use RStudio Server on Ceres, a user submits a SLURM job script. A default job script that should suffice for most users is provided.After a user is done using RStudio Server, they should save their work in RStudio, and then stop RStudio Server by cancelling the job with the slurm  scancel  command.Starting RStudio ServerThe instructions below tell to use RStudio version 3.6.0 . To see other versions available on Ceres issue:ls -l /reference/containers/RStudio/ If you wish to use a different version, replace 3.6.0 below with the version number you choose.        (If using VPN) Connect to SCINet VPN (see video instructions):   VPN Using the OpenConnect Client  VPN Using the Cisco AnyConnect Client           Log into Ceres via SSH (see the Quick Start Guide for instructions).      Submit the RStudio SLURM job script with the following command:     sbatch /reference/containers/RStudio/3.6.0/rstudio.job          (Optional) By default, this SLURM job is limited to a 4 hour time limit, 1 processor core, and 6600 MB memory. To customize, see the section Requesting Additional Compute Resources below.      After the job has started, view the “$HOME/rstudio-JOBID.out” file for login information (where JOBID is the SLURM job ID reported by the sbatch command). Here is an example of such a file. Your file will have different job number, user name, password, compute node name and port number.     [jane.user@sn-cn-8-1 ~]$ sbatch /reference/containers/RStudio/3.6.0/rstudio.job Submitted batch job 214664  [jane.user@sn-cn-8-1 ~]$ cat ~/rstudio-214664.out VPN Users:  1. Connect to SCINet VPN and point your web browser to http://ceres14-compute-3-eth.scinet.local:44200  2. log in to RStudio Server using the following credentials:     user: jane.user    password: 4wjRJfpIvQDtKdDZpmzY  SSH users:  1. SSH tunnel from your workstation using the following command (macOS or Linux only;    for how to enter this in PuTTY on Windows see the Ceres RStudio User Guide)     ssh -N -L 8787:ceres14-compute-3-eth.scinet.local:44200 jane.user@ceres.scinet.usda.gov     and point your web browser to http://localhost:8787  2. log in to RStudio Server using the following credentials:     user: jane.user    password: 4wjRJfpIvQDtKdDZpmzY  When done using RStudio Server, terminate the job by:  1. Exit the RStudio Session (power button in the top right corner of the RStudio window) 2. On the Ceres command line, issue the command     scancel -f 214664           Instructions for this step differ for when you use SCINet VPN or SSH Port Forwarding. Using VPNIf using VPN point your web browser to the listed hostname / port (in the example above, http://ceres14-compute-3-eth.scinet.local:44200), then enter your SCINet user name and the temporary password (valid only for this job only; in this example 4wjRJfpIvQDtKdDZpmzY) SSH Port Forwarding (instead of VPN)Note Before performing the instructions below, first read and follow the instructions in steps 2-4.Windows + PuTTY users   Open a new PuTTY window   In Session &gt; Host Name, enter: ceres.scinet.usda.gov   In the category: Connection &gt; SSH &gt; Tunnels, enter 8787 in Source Port, the Destination hostname:port listed in the job script output (in this example: ceres14-compute-3-eth:44200), click “Add”, then click “Open”.    Point your browser to http://localhost:8787. Enter your SCINet user name, and one-time password listed in the job script output file. macOS / Linux / Windows + Windows PowerShell users   Open a new macOS/Linux terminal window or a new Windows PowerShell window and enter the SSH command listed in the job script output file. In this example:     ssh -N -L 8787:ceres14-compute-3-eth.scinet.local:44200 jane.user@ceres.scinet.usda.gov          There will be no output after logging in. Keep the window / SSH tunnel open for the duration of the RStudio session.      Point your browser to http://localhost:8787. Enter your SCINet user name, and one-time password listed in the job script output file. Stopping RStudio Server   Click the Quit Session (“power”) button in the top-right corner of the RStudio window (see picture below), or select “File &gt; Quit Session…”    After the “R Session has Ended” window appears, cancel the SLURM job from the Ceres command line. E.g., if the job ID is 214664:     [jane.user@sn-cn-8-1 ~]$ scancel -f 214664          Be sure to specify the  scancel -f  /  --full  option as demonstrated above.      (If using SSH Port Forwarding instead of VPN) Close the terminal / PuTTY window in which the SSH tunnel was established. Requesting Additional Compute ResourcesThe default job resources (4 hour time limit, 1 processor core, 6600 MB memory) may be customized by:   sbatch command-line options, e.g., to specify an 8-hour wall time limit, 16 G memory, and 2 processor cores (= 4 hardware threads):     sbatch --time=08:00:00 --mem=16G --cpus-per-task=4 /reference/containers/RStudio/3.6.0/rstudio.job           Copying the job script to a directory one has write access to and modifying the appropriate SLURM #SBATCH directives.   Using the Ceres Job Script Generator to create a new job RStudio Server job script            In the Job Script Template drop down menu, select RStudio Server         "

You could do this with:     rclone copy /project/bogus_genome usdabox:/scinetbackup/bogus_genome --verbose         Advanced commandsThis advanced guide assumes you have read the previous page and have some familiarity with rclone already.Rclone supports “overlay” filesystems which can be then be overlayed in multiple layers.In this guide we will discuss the “crypt” and “chunk” overlays.  Using these 2 in combination can overcome virtually all of the limitations of any of the remote services.  i.e.. no 5, 10, or 15GB limit per file, no restrictions on special characters in filenames, etc. The overlays also provide some data protection by doing md5 checksums on the files transferred, if desired.  You should very much desire this.The process here is:   Create a basic store   Apply a crypt overlay.  This gets you encryption and works around filename limitations.   Apply a chunk overlay.  This gets around file size limitations. We are going to assume you have  already created a basic functional remote, In this case mine is called “google:”First we create a folder in the remote to hold our encrypted data.  I called mine “crypt”$ rclone mkdir google:crypt Next run rclone config choosing crypt as the remote type and then use the name of your new folder as the path.  You will want to encrypt the directory names to avoid character limitation issues in the path.You must remember the password(s) you chose here. Your data will not be recoverable by anyone if your forget or lose it.

  "date" : "May 19, 2023",
  "content" : "Users will run their applications on the cluster in either interactive mode or in batch mode. Interactive mode ( salloc  or  srun  command) is familiar to anyone using the command line: the user specifies an application by name and various arguments, hits Enter, and the application runs. However, in interactive mode on a cluster the user is automatically switched from using a login node to using a compute node. This keeps all the intense computation off the login nodes, so that login nodes can have all the resources necessary for managing the cluster. You should always use interactive mode when you are running your application but not using batch mode. Please do not run your applications on the login nodes, use the interactive mode. Interactive mode should only be used when interaction is required, for example when preparing or debugging a pipeline. Otherwise the batch mode should be used. Batch mode requires the user to write a short job script (see examples at section Batch Mode) or use the Ceres Job Script Generator.Ceres uses Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM) to submit interactive and batch jobs to the compute nodes. Requested resources can be specified either within the job script or using options with the  salloc,  srun, or  sbatch  commands.Partitions or QueuesCompute jobs are run on functional groups of nodes called partitions or queues. Each different partition has different capabilities (e.g. regular memory versus high memory nodes) and resource restrictions (e.g. time limits on jobs). Nodes may appear in several partitions.Some of the Ceres compute nodes have been purchased by individual researchers or research groups. These nodes are available to the owners in the priority* partitions but can also be used by anyone on the cluster through *-low and scavenger* partitions. These partitions have been introduced to increase usage of the priority nodes while still allowing node owners to have guaranteed fast access to priority nodes. All *-low partitions have 2-hour time limit. Scavenger* partitions have 3-weeks time limit, but jobs in this partition will be killed when resources are requested for the jobs in priority* partitions. Since jobs in the scavenger* partitions can be killed at any moment, running in those partitions does not affect job priorities in the community partitions.The following table lists partitions. Number of nodes in a specific partition can be adjusted from time to time and be different from the one published in this document.Community partitions               Name       Nodes       Logical Cores per Node       Maximum Simulation Time       Default Memory per Core       Function                       short       41       72,96       48 hours       3000 MB       short simulation queue (default)                 medium       32       72,96       7 days       3000 MB       medium length simulation queue                 long       11       72,96       21 days       3000 MB       long simulation queue                 long60       2       72       60 days       3000 MB       extra long simulation queue                 mem       4       80       7 days       16000 MB       large memory queue                 longmem       1       80       1000 hours       16000 MB       long simulation large memory queue                 mem768       1       80       7 days       7900 MB       new node with 768GB of memory                 debug       2       72,96       1 hour       3000 MB       for testing scripts and runs before submitting them         Partitions that allow all users access to priority nodes               Name       Nodes       Logical Cores per Node       Maximum Simulation Time       Default Memory per Core       Function                       mem768-low       3       80       2 hours       7900 MB       priority nodes with 768GB of memory                 mem-low       16       80,96       2 hours       16000 MB       priority nodes with 1.5TB of memory                 gpu-low       1       72       2 hours       3000 MB       priority GPU node                 brief-low       92       72,96       2 hours       3000 MB       all new nodes with 384GB of memory                 scavenger       49       72,80       21 days       3000 MB       non-GPU priority nodes; scavenger jobs can be killed at any moment                 scavenger-gpu       1       72       21 days       3000 MB       GPU priority node; jobs can be killed at any moment         Priority partitions available only to those users who purchased nodes               Name       Nodes       Maximum Simulation Time       Default Memory per Core       Function                       priority       49       2 weeks       3000 MB       priority nodes with 384GB memory                 priority-mem       16       2 weeks       16000 MB       priority nodes with 1.5TB memory                 priority-mem768       3       2 weeks       7900 MB       priority nodes with 768 GB memory                 priority-gpu       1       2 weeks       3000 MB       priority GPU node         At most 1440 cores and 5760 GB of memory can be used by all simultaneously running jobs per user across all community and *-low partitions. In addition, up to 800 cores and 2100 GB of memory can be used by jobs in scavenger* partitions. Any additional jobs will be queued but won’t start. At times these limits can be lowered to prevent a small group of users overtaking the whole cluster.Users that have access to priority partitions are limited by the amount of resources purchased by the group. For example, if a group has purchased one 768GB node, then group members cannot use more than an equivalent of one 768GB node across all jobs simulteniously running in priority-mem768 partition even when there are idle nodes in the partition. However all users on the system can use these idle nodes through *-low and scavenger* partitions. Each group that has purchased nodes on Ceres, has a special QOS created for it. To list QOSes for your account, issue “sacctmgr -Pns show user format=qos”. The group’s QOS needs to be specified when submitting a job to a priority partition via the “-q” salloc/sbatch/srun option. When users submit a job to a priority partition, any node in the partition can be assigned to the job.To get current details on all partitions use the following scontrol command:$ scontrol show partitions Resource AllocationAllocation of CoresOn Ceres hyper-threading is turned on. That means that each physical core on a node appears as two separate processors to the operating system and can run two threads. The smallest unit of allocation per job is a single hyper-threaded core, or 2 logical cores, corresponding to specifying  -n 2  on  salloc/srun/sbatch  commands (i.e. jobs cannot access a single hyper-thread within a core). If a job requests an odd number of cores (-n 1, -n 3,…) SLURM will automatically allocate the next larger even number of cores.Allocation of MemoryEach allocated core comes with a default amount of memory listed in the table above for different SLURM partitions. If a job attempts to use more memory than what was allocated to a job it will be killed by SLURM. In order to make more memory available to a given job, users can either request the appropriate total number of cores or request more memory per core via the  --mem-per-cpu  flag to  salloc/srun/sbatch  commands.For example, to support a job that requires 60GB of memory in the short partition, a user could request 20 logical cores (-n 20) with their default allocation of 3000MB or 2 logical cores with 30GB of memory per core via  --mem-per-cpu 30GB. Please note that a single hyper-threaded core (2 logical cores) is the smallest unit of allocation. Of course, any other mix of memory per core and total number of cores totaling 60GB would work as well depending on the CPU characteristics of the underlying simulation software.Allocation of TimeWhen submitting interactive or batch job users can specify time limit by using the  -t  (–time=) option on  salloc/srun/sbatch  commands. If the time limit is not explicitly specified, it will be set to the partition’s Maximum Simulation Time (see the table above).Slurm accountsTo provide better Ceres usage report all Ceres users have been assigned Slurm accounts based on their project groups. If you don’t have a project, then your default and only Slurm account is sandbox. If you have more than one project, then your default Slurm account is one of the project names. You can specify a different Slurm account when submitting a job by using “-A ” option on salloc/srun/sbatch command or adding “#SBATCH -A ” to the job script.To see all your Slurm accounts and your default account at any time, use “sacctmgr -Pns show user format=account,defaultaccount”You can change your default Slurm account running slurm-account-selector.sh on the login node.Interactive ModeA user can request an interactive session on Ceres using SLURM’s  srun  or  salloc  commands. The simplest way to request an interactive job is by entering the command  salloc:$ salloc which will place you in an interactive shell. This interactive shell has a duration of 2 days and will request a single hyper-threaded core (2 logical cores) with 6000 MB of allocated memory on one of the compute nodes.To prevent users from requesting interactive nodes and then not using them, there is an inactivity timeout set up. If there is no command running on a node for an hour and a half, the job will be terminated. Otherwise the interactive job is terminated when the user types exit or the allocated time runs out.For more fine grained control over the interactive environment you can use the  srun  command. Issue the  srun  command from a login node. Command syntax is:$ srun --pty -p queue -t hh:mm:ss -n tasks -N nodes /bin/bash -l                Option       Value                       -p       queue (partition)                 -t       maximum runtime                 -n       number of cores                 -N       number of nodes         The following example commands illustrate an interactive session where the user requests 1 hour in the short queue, using 1 compute node and 20 logical cores (half of the cores available on the original compute node), using the bash shell, followed by a BLAST search of a protein database.Start the interactive session:$ srun --pty -p short -t 01:00:00 -n 20 -N 1 /bin/bash -l Load NCBI-BLAST+ on the compute node:$ module load blast+ Uncompress the nr.gz FASTA file that contains your sequence database:$ gzip -d nr.gz Generate the blast database:$ makeblastdb -in nr -dbtype prot Search the nr database in serial mode with a set of queries in the FASTA file blastInputs.fa:$ blastp -db nr -query blastInputs.fa -out blastout Return to the login node:$ exit Requesting the Proper Number of Nodes and CoresSLURM allows you to precisely choose the allocation of compute cores across nodes. Below are a number of examples that show different ways to allocate an 8 core job across the Ceres cluster               salloc/srun/sbatch  options       core distribution across nodes                       -n 8       pick any available cores across the cluster (may be on several nodes or not)                 -n 8 -N 8       spread 8 cores across 8 distinct nodes (i.e. one core per node)                 -n 8 --ntasks-per-node=1       same as  -n 8 -N 8                 -n 8 -N 4       request 8 cores on 4 nodes (however the spread might be uneven, i.e. one node could end up with 5 cores and one core each for the remaining 3 nodes)                 -n 8 --ntasks-per-node=2       request 8 cores on 4 nodes with 2 cores per node                 -n 8 -N 1       request 8 cores on a single node                 -n 8 --ntasks-per-node=8       same as  -n 8 -N 1         Batch ModeSerial JobJobs can be submitted to various partitions or queues using SLURM’s sbatch command. The following is an example of how to run a blastp serial job using a job script named “blastSerialJob.sh”. The content of blastSerialJob.sh is as follows:#!/bin/bash #SBATCH --job-name=blastp   #name of this job #SBATCH -p short              #name of the partition (queue) you are submitting to #SBATCH -N 1                  #number of nodes in this job #SBATCH -n 40                 #number of cores/tasks in this job, you get all 20 physical cores with 2 threads per core with hyper-threading #SBATCH -t 01:00:00           #time allocated for this job hours:mins:seconds #SBATCH --mail-user=emailAddress   #enter your email address to receive emails #SBATCH --mail-type=BEGIN,END,FAIL #will receive an email when job starts, ends or fails #SBATCH -o stdout.%j.%N     # standard output, %j adds job number to output file name and %N adds the node name #SBATCH -e stderr.%j.%N     #optional, prints our standard error date                          #optional, prints out timestamp at the start of the job in stdout file module load blast+            #loading latest NCBI BLAST+ module blastp -db nr -query blastInputs -out blastout  # protein blast search against nr database date                          #optional, prints out timestamp when the job ends #End of file Launch the job like this:$ sbatch blastSerialJob.sh Running a Simple OpenMP JobThe following example will demonstrate how to use threads. We will use the following OpenMP C code to print “hello world” on each thread. First copy and paste this code into a file, e.g. “testOpenMP.c”.#include &lt;omp.h&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; int main(int argc, char* argv[]){  int id;  #pragma omp parallel private(id)   {   id=omp_get_thread_num();   printf(%d: hello world /n,id);  }  return 0; } Now load the gcc module and compile the code :$ module load gcc $ gcc testOpenMP.c -fopenmp -o testOpenMP Now create a batch job script (OMPjob.sh) to test number of threads you requested:#!/bin/bash #SBATCH --job-name=OpenMP #SBATCH -p short #SBATCH -N 1 #SBATCH -n 20 #SBATCH --threads-per-core=1 #SBATCH -t 00:30:00 #SBATCH -o stdout.%j.%N #SET the number of openmp threads export OMP_NUM_THREADS=20 ./testOpenMP # End of file Launch the job using the batch script like this:$ sbatch OMPjob.sh The stdout* file from the above job script should contain 20 lines with “hello world” from each thread.Parallel MPI JobThe following is the example to run Hybrid RAxML which uses both MPI and PTHREADS. It will start 2 MPI processes (one per node) and each process will run 40 threads (one thread per logical core).Create a SLURM script like this (for example, RAxMLjob.sh, but use your own alignment file rather than “align.fasta”):#!/bin/bash #SBATCH --job-name=raxmlMPI #SBATCH -p short #SBATCH -N 2 #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=40 #SBATCH -t 01:00:00 #SBATCH -o stdout.%j.%N # We requested 2 nodes, 40 logical cores per node for a total of 80 logical cores for this job module load raxml            #loading latest raxml module, which will also load an MPI module mpirun -np 2 raxmlHPC-MPI-AVX -T 40 -n raxmlMPI -f a -x 12345 -p 12345 -m GTRGAMMA -# 100 -s align.fasta # End of file And execute it with sbatch:$ sbatch RAxMLjob.sh Useful SLURM Commands               Command       Description       Example                       squeue       Gives information about jobs       squeue  or  squeue -u jane.webb                 scancel       Stop and remove jobs       scancel &lt;job id&gt;  or  scancel -u jane.webb                 sinfo       Gives information about queues (partitions) or nodes       sinfo  or  sinfo -N -l                 scontrol       Provides more detailed information about jobs, partitions or nodes       scontrol show job &lt;job id&gt;  or  scontrol show partition &lt;partition name&gt;  or  scontrol show nodes                 seff       Provides resource usage report for a finished job       seff &lt;job id&gt;         Local Scratch SpaceAll compute nodes have 1.5 TB of fast local temporary data file storage space supported by SSDs. This local scratch space is significantly faster and supports more input/output operations per second (IOPS) than the mounted filesystems on which the home and project directories reside. A job sets up a unique local space accessible available only with the job script via the environmental $TMPDIR variable. You can use this for any scratch space disk space you need, or if you plan to compute on an existing large data set (such as a sequence assembly job) it might be beneficial to copy all your input data to this space at the beginning of your job, and then do all your computation on $TMPDIR. You must copy any output data you need to keep back to permanent storage before the job ends, since $TMPDIR will be erased upon job exit. The following example shows how to copy data in, and then run from $TMPDIR.#!/bin/bash #SBATCH --job-name=my sequence assembly   #name of the job submitted #SBATCH -p short              #name of the queue you are submitting job to #SBATCH -N 1                  #number of nodes in this job #SBATCH -n 40                 #number of cores/tasks in this job, you get all 20 cores with 2 threads per core with hyper-threading #SBATCH -t 01:00:00           #time allocated for this job hours:mins:seconds #SBATCH --mail-user=emailAddress   #enter your email address to receive emails #SBATCH --mail-type=BEGIN,END,FAIL #will receive an email when job starts, ends or fails #SBATCH -o stdout.%j.%N     # standard out %j adds job number to output file name and %N adds the node name #SBATCH -e stderr.%j.%N     #optional, it prints out standard error  # start staging data to the job temporary directory in $TMPDIR MYDIR=`pwd` /bin/cp –r $MYDIR $TMPDIR/ cd $TMPDIR   # add regular job commands like module load and running scientific software   # copy output data off of local scratch /bin/cp -r output $MYDIR/output   # If you do not know the output names, you can issue: #   rsync –a $TMPDIR/*  $MYDIR/ # which will only copy back new or changed files, but rsync takes longer.   #End of file "

  "content" : "Some software packages may not be available for the version of Linux running on the HPC cluster. In this case, users may want to run containers. Containers are self-contained application execution environments that contain all necessary software to run an application or workflow, so users don’t need to worry about installing all the dependencies. There are many pre-built container images for scientific applications available for download and use.Singularity https://sylabs.io/ is an application for running containers on an HPC cluster. Containers are self-contained application execution environments that contain all necessary software to run an application or workflow, so you don’t need to worry about installing all the dependencies. There are many pre-built container images for scientific applications available for download and use, see section Container Images. PrerequisitesTo run containers on Ceres, you’ll need to execute the singularity command from a compute node. For example, to run an interactive session on a compute node, use the SLURM salloc command:[user.name@ceres ~]$ salloc salloc: Granted job allocation 1695904 salloc: Waiting for resource configuration salloc: Nodes ceres20-compute-44 are ready for job export TMPDIR=/local/bgfs//1695904 export TMOUT=5400 [user.name@ceres20-compute-44 ]$ module load singularity [user.name@ceres20-compute-44 ]$ NOTE: salloc by default runs on a single hyper-threaded core (2 logical cores) with 6000 MB of allocated memory on one of the compute nodes. The session will last for 2 days, but will timeout after 1.5 hours of inactivity (no commands runnning). See the Running Jobs User Guide for more info on how to request resources for interactive jobs.Container ImagesSingularity executes a container from a Singularity container image either created by the user or downloaded from Singularity Library https://cloud.sylabs.io/library, and can also import and execute Docker https://www.docker.com/ container images, either directly uploaded by the user, or downloaded from Docker Hub https://hub.docker.com/.BioContainers is a “community-driven project that provides the infrastructure and basic guidelines to create, manage and distribute Bioinformatics [Docker] containers with special focus in Proteomics, Genomics, Transcriptomics and Metabolomics.”BioContainers can be obtained either via docker https://hub.docker.com/u/biocontainers/ or via Quay https://quay.io/For leveraging GPU using containers, Nvidia provides a container library NGC. https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/all   NGC offers a comprehensive catalog of GPU-accelerated software for deep learning, machine learning, and HPC. NGC containers deliver powerful and easy-to-deploy software proven to deliver the fastest results. By taking care of the plumbing, NGC enables users to focus on building lean models, producing optimal solutions and gathering faster insights. Docker ImagesWhile Singularity can only execute containers from Singularity images, it can easily import Docker images directly from Docker Hub to create a Singularity image. For example, to download a Docker image of the R programming language from Docker Hub [https://hub.docker.com//r-base/](https://hub.docker.com//r-base/) and import it into a Singularity image, change the docker pull rbase command listed at the aforementioned URL to the equivalent Singularity command  singularity pull docker://r-base  (where specifying “docker://” before the image name lets Singularity know the image is a Docker image, and by default fetch the image from Docker Hub):[user.name@sceres20-compute-44 ~]$ singularity pull docker://r-base INFO:    Converting OCI blobs to SIF format INFO:    Starting build... Getting image source signatures Copying blob 1fcd5305bc72 done  ... INFO:    Creating SIF file... INFO:    Build complete: r-base_latest.sif   The resulting singularity image (r-base.img) contains a complete environment (operating system, libraries, R installation) for running R. A tag may be specified when selecting the Docker image to download; e.g., a list of tags for r-base is at: https://hub.docker.com/r/library/r-base/tags/. To specify a specific tag, append “:TAG” to the image name (e.g.,  singularity pull docker://r-base:3.3.3 ). If the tag is omitted, Singularity will look for an image labeled with the “latest” tag (note that the “latest” tag is merely a Docker Hub convention, and is not guaranteed to exist, nor is it guaranteed to point to the latest image—when in doubt, specify the tag).Note on Home directory and SingularityWhile pulling/building the containers, pay attention to the home directory as the cached image blobs will be saved in ${HOME}/.singularity . Since the home directory has a limited amount of space, this can fill up quite easily. Users can change where the files will be cached by setting SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR and SINGULARITY_TMPDIR environment variables. On Ceres we set SINGULARITY_TMPDIR to $TMPDIR. We also set SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR to $TMPDIR for all Slurm jobs if it’s not set by the user. As of January 13, 2022, these variables are not automatically set on Atlas. We recommend adding the following two commands to the job scripts that use singularity:export SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=$TMPDIR  export SINGULARITY_TMPDIR=$TMPDIR One can also use –disable-cache option to avoid saving cached image blobs (e.g., singularity pull --disable-cache docker://r-base:3.3.3 ).In case the home directory is full, it is safe to delete the contents of ~/.singularity folder.Singularity ImagesSingularity LibrarySingularity Library is a service that builds Singularity images from community-provided recipes (called “bootstrap files”) stored in GitHub repositories and makes them available for search and download. To download a singularity image, search the Singularity Library container collections, and follow the instructions to download and execute the container. This is similar to the directions for container images from Docker Hub, except replace the “docker://” URI prefix with “library://”.Creating Your Own Singularity ImagesRoot access is needed to create a Singularity image from a bootstrap file. As Ceres users do not have root access, to create your own Singularity image, you can paste the bootstrap file to Singualrity cloud builder https://cloud.sylabs.io/builder.Bootstrap examples - https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/tree/master/examplesExecuting ContainersThree commands may be used to execute applications inside Singularity containers:singularity run,singularity exec,and (less commonly) singularity shellNote that applications executing within a container do not have access to applications installed outside of the container (e.g., environment modules, or executables installed in /usr/bin on the compute node).singularity runSingularity images may have a run script (Docker: ENTRYPOINT) that is executed when the singularity run command is used. To see the run script defined by the container (if any), use the singularity inspect command:[user.name@ceres20-compute-44 ~]$ singularity inspect --runscript r-base.img #!/bin/sh exec R $@ The output above shows that in the aforementioned Docker image for the R programming language retrieved from Docker Hub,  singularity run r-base.img  will run R interactively in the container environment. Your home directory is automatically mounted in the container, so any files therein can be accessed (and R packages installed within the container, as illustrated in the example below):[user.name@ceres20-compute-44 ~]$ singularity run r-base.img R version 3.4.0 (2017-04-21) -- You Stupid Darkness Copyright (C) 2017 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit) ... &gt; install.packages(stringr) Installing package into '/usr/local/lib/R/site-library' (as 'lib' is unspecified) Warning in install.packages(stringr) : 'lib = /usr/local/lib/R/site-library' is not writable Would you like to use a personal library instead?

The singularity exec command can be used to select which program to run in the container. For example, to run a simple R script using the Rscript command in the container, prefix the Rscript command with  singularity exec r-base.img:[user.name@ceres20-compute-44 ~]$ cat test.R summary(c(1:10)) [user.name@ceres20-compute-44 ~]$ singularity exec r-base.img Rscript test.R Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 1.00 3.25 5.50 5.50 7.75 10.00 singularity shellsingularity shell starts an interactive shell within the container image, allowing you to inspect files (and execute programs) within the container. For example, here we see that the r-base.img container image was created using Debian Linux as the base operating system:[user.name@ceres20-compute-44 ~]$ type R bash: type: R: not found [user.name@ceres20-compute-44 ~]$ singularity shell r-base.img Singularity: Invoking an interactive shell within container...

In this case, the entry point is a subreadset file. If a subreadset file does not exist or if there multiple subreadset files that you want to combine, click here for instructions to create datasets.Generate workflow templateThis template is used to talk to SLURM workload manager to divvy up taskspbsmrtpipe show-workflow-options -j workflow-template.json To submit jobs to a different partition replace the value for the pbsmrtpipe.options.cluster_manager KEY in the generated workflow template file with one of the provided options as shown below:pbsmrtpipe.options.cluster_manager: /system/smrtanalysis/7/slurm_template/short pbsmrtpipe.options.cluster_manager: /system/smrtanalysis/7/slurm_template/medium pbsmrtpipe.options.cluster_manager: /system/smrtanalysis/7/slurm_template/mem Users can also copy the template directory and modify values to specify a different partition. For example, to submit jobs to priority partition, in your copy of the template directory make the following changes in file jmsenv_00.ish :JMSCONFIG_SLURM_PARTITION=priority;   # Partition  JMSCONFIG_SLURM_START_ARGS='--qos=gbru --timelimit=7-00:00:00';  # gbru is a example, choose relevant QOS in file start.tmpl :--jmsenv &lt;path_to_your_template_directory&gt;/jmsenv_00.ish # Change the path to your custom template file After these changes, make sure “pbsmrtpipe.options.cluster_manager”: in the workflow template file points to your template directory.   Note that only research groups that purchased nodes on the Ceres cluster have access to priority partitions. Generating a datasetRaw BAM files are usually accompanied by several XML files.

  "description" : "Guide to storage options on SCINet HPC clusters",
  "date" : "May 19, 2023",
  "content" : "This document provides detailed information about the storage options provided by SCINet and how to use them.  For a simpler overview of suggested procedures for managing data on SCINet, please see Managing Data on ARS HPC and Storage Infrastructure.There are multiple places to store data on the Ceres and Atlas clusters that all serve different purposes.QuotasHome directories, project directories in /project and on Juno Archive Storage have quotas. Home directories have 10GB quota. The default project directory quota in /project is set to 1TB. Note that quotas for project directories on Ceres and Atlas may differ. To see the current usage and quotas for your home and project directories on Ceres, as well as on Juno, issue the my_quotas command on the Ceres login node. On Atlas, issue “/apps/bin/reportFSUsage -p proj1,proj2,proj3”, substituting proj# with project name(s).Quotas on Ceres are based off file group ownership/association. By default files in a home directory are associated with the user’s primary group that has the same name as the user name, while files in a project directory are associated with the project group (proj-). Sometimes when users move files from one directory to another or rsync files using `-a` or `-g` and `-p`  options, files in the new location will retain group from the old location and setgid bit will not be set. (The setgid bit needs to be set so that new files and directories created in the directory in /project would be associated with the project group.) To avoid this, use `cp` and `rm` instead of `mv`  to move data between home and project directories, and use `-rltoD` rsync options instead  of `-a` or explicitly specify `--no-p --no-g` options.The “beegfs-ctl --getquota --gid $USER --cfgFile=/etc/beegfs/beegfs-client-project.conf” command will report usage and quota for your primary group in /project. This quota is  intentionally set to a small value. The non-zero usage indicates that there are files associated with the user’s primary group in /project . To set ownership of the files in a directory in /project to the project group and to set the setgid bit, the user can issue the following command:find /project/&lt;project_name&gt;/&lt;dir&gt; -exec chgrp proj-&lt;project_name&gt; {} + -a -type d -exec chmod g+s {} +  Home DirectoriesHome directories are private, they are only accessible to the user and the system administrators. When a user logs  into Ceres or Atlas, they are automatically logged into their home directory /home/firstname.lastname.Home directories have 10GB quotas and are intended to be mainly used for configuration and login files. Computations  should be run from project directories in /90daydata or in /project. Software installs that require a lot of space,  such as conda virtual environments, should be done in /project.Files in home directories are automatically compressed and backed up. Due to backup method used on Ceres, space freed  after deleting files in home directories, becomes available only after 6 days.Project DirectoriesProject directories are usually associated with ARS Research Projects. While it’s possible to run simulations on Ceres or Atlas using only home directories and Large Short-term Storage in /90daydata/shared, it is recommended to request a project directory. Having a project directory will allow to install software packages in /project and keep important data on Juno Archive Storage.To request a new project directory see Request Project Storage. Here is a direct link to the form (eAuthentication required) which includes submitting a Data Management Plan:Request a project directoryDefault quota for /project/&lt;project_name&gt; is set to 1TB. Historically, before Juno Archive Storage has been deployed, large space had routinely been allocated in /project, but going forward, additional space in /project will only be allocated on an as-needed basis. Most users should use /90daydata to run analysis, and the results should be copied to Juno Archive Storage.Many software applications are available on the clusters as modules, however sometimes  users need to install software by themselves. Since home directories have a small quota, it is recommended to install software,  such as Python, Perl, R packages and conda virtual environments in /project/&lt;project_name&gt;.  The Conda Guide provides instructions  on how to install conda virtual environments in /project, while  Guide to Installing R, Python, and Perl Packages has examples of installing packages in a project directory.Directories in /project are not automatically backed up. Data that cannot be easily reproduced should be manually copied to Juno.Project directories are usually shared between group members working on the same project. Each project directory has a manager (usually the PI on the ARS project who requested the project directory). Project manager can give and revoke access to the project directory to other SCINet users either in FreeIPA or via command line on Ceres or Atlas:ipa group-add-member proj-&lt;project_name&gt; --users=&lt;scinet_username&gt; ipa group-remove-member proj-&lt;project_name&gt; --users=&lt;scinet_username&gt; Note: When ssh-ing to the cluster from a connected site, you may need to issue “kinit” command and enter your SCINet password before issuing ipa commands above.After being added to the proj- project group, users will be able to access `/project/` and `/90daydata/` both on Ceres and Atlas, as well as `/LTS/project/` on Juno.If you prefer using GUI, connect to SCINet VPN and go to https://aws-ipa-0.scinet.usda.gov/. Login using your SCINet user name and password (do not add the GA verification code). Then click on “Groups” and search for your project. After clicking on the project group (group-), you will see the list of users in the group. To add new member(s) click on “+Add”, this will open a pop-up window where you can search for the user. After selecting user name click on “&gt;”. Once the user name appears on the right side under “Prospective”, click on “Add” button in the bottom right corner of the pop-up window. To revoke user access, check-mark next to the user name and click on “Delete” button.Large Short-term StorageSince project directories in /project have limited quotas, in most cases computations should be run from /90daydata/&lt;project_name&gt; which does  not have quota. However, files with an access time (atime) older than 90 days will be automatically deleted. This is permanent and the files cannot  be recovered. Just like /project there is no backup for this space. Data that cannot be easily reproduced should be manually copied to Juno./90daydata/shared is open to all users on Ceres and Atlas. Anyone can create a directory in /90daydata/shared and put data which will be readable  by everyone on the system unless file owner limits access using chmod command. Files older than 90 days will be automatically deleted.Warning: If you download archived files, they may contain files with an access date from long ago. This date will still trigger deletion,  so make sure that the files have a new access date. For example, when you untar a .tar or .tgz file, use the -m flag. If you use rsync to  the space, do not use the -a flag, as that preserves date stamps.Temporary Local Node StorageOne can use the storage on the disk drive on each of the compute nodes by reading and writing to $TMPDIR (1.5TB on most compute nodes).  This is temporary storage that can  be used only during the execution of your job. Only processes executing on a node have access to this space.  Multiple jobs running on the  same node share this space, so an individual job may be able to use less than total available space. If all local space is needed for a job,  request the whole node.To use this local storage the following workflow should be used.  These steps may be taken interactively (when salloc’d to a compute node)  or in batch-mode. In batch mode the copy commands below should be added to the job script.   Copy calculation input to the local filesystem, e.g.,     cp /project/&lt;project_name&gt;/&lt;input files&gt; $TMPDIR          where &lt;project_name&gt; is the name of your project directory and &lt;input files&gt; contains the folders/files to be used by your job (to copy the  whole folder use -r option).           Run your code, getting input from files located in $TMPDIR and writing output to $TMPDIR      Copy final results to storage location, e.g.:     cp $TMPDIR/&lt;final results&gt; /project/&lt;project_name&gt;/&lt;final results&gt;         Note that files in $TMPDIR will disappear at the conclusion of your job.  Any data which is not copied out of $TMPDIR cannot be recovered  after your job has finished.This storage is useful for workflows that extensively use disk space reading and writing multiple small files.Juno Archive StorageProject directories are not meant to be used as a data archive. Data that cannot be easily reproduced should be manually backed up to Juno. Juno is a large, multi-petabyte ARS storage device at the National Agricultural Library in Maryland. For instructions on how to transfer data to and from Juno, see Managing Data on ARS HPC and Storage Infrastructure"

  "content" : "CRISPR-Cas is a powerful tool for gene editing. CRISPR can also be used to discover gene function by disrupting every gene in the genome and screening millions of cells in parallel. This “CRISPR screen” or “CRISPR pool” technique knocks out (disrupts) the function of thousands of genes in a large pool of cells. Each cell has only a single gene knockout, but the cells collectively have nearly every gene in their genome disrupted. This can be done in any bacterial culture or eukaryotic cell line where a vector can be introduced and cells can be grown in culture. The population of mutated cells is then grown in the presence of a compound like a toxin, drug, or metabolite. After growth, we extract DNA from control and treatment cell populations at the beginning and end of the experiment. The Cas cut sites are amplified and sequenced. These data are used to create a tally of the mutations in the control and treatment populations. Mutations that improve fitness in the presence of the compound are enriched and can be identified statistically. At the end of an experiment, we have a small list of genes that are likely involved in responding to the compound. These genes can be investigated in more detail to work out the exact mechanisms of their effect.Cas enzymes in a CRISPR-Cas system target a specific site in the genome for cleavage by recognizing a Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) site and an adjacent target site in the genome. Each Cas enzyme type recognizes its own PAM sites, for example, SpCas9 recognizes sites in the genome with the nucleotides “NGG”. Cas cleavage is site-specific because it only cuts in the presence of a guide RNA sequence that has a specific ~20-25 bp long sequencing matching a point in the genome next to a PAM site. Designing these guides to target every gene in the genome multiple times is challenging. Every guide RNA needs to target a single site in the genome and needs to be somewhat different from similar guides for specificity. There are also design considerations for how efficient a guide will be at knocking out a gene. Once the complicated design process is complete, the guide oligonucleotides can be commercially synthesized in one large pool. The pooled guide oligonucleotides are then cloned, amplified, and put into an expression vector that allows it to be expressed in a population of cells. There are standard molecular tools to do this in most organisms.One of the major challenges of conducting CRISPR screens is designing the guide RNAs that target specific sites in the genome. This is especially true when dealing with a non-model organism or a less common Cas enzyme system. To address this problem, my group, in collaboration with researchers at the University of Florida, created user-friendly guide design software that can rapidly create guides for any genome or Cas enzyme. A web application version of GuideMaker is hosted at https://guidemaker.app.scinet.usda.gov and as a tool in the Cyverse Discovery Environment. A command-line version of the software is also available at https://guidemaker.org. Under the hood, GuideMaker implements several unique machine learning methods including a powerful method for approximate nearest neighbor search (HNSW) and a model to predict on-target binding originally  designed by Microsoft Research. I hope that my software can bring the power of CRISPR functional gene discovery to more scientists at ARS and I am happy to help ARS scientists get started with the method. SCINet resources were critical to the development of the software. We extensively benchmarked the software using multiple compute nodes on Ceres and Atlas. An article describing the software in detail is in press at the journal GigaScience."

  "content" : "Photo: We sequenced and analyzed seed transcriptomes of 75 soybean lines representing 90 years of North American soybean breeding history for identifying breeder-selected genes and alleles. Ancestral soybeans (blue dots) of Asia were introduced in North America and used to breed the modern soybean cultivars (red dots) in North AmericaSoybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) is a versatile, nutrients-laden, economically invaluable crop with capacity to restore soil fertility through atmospheric nitrogen fixation. It holds great significance in ensuring adequate global nutritional food security and environment-friendly sustainable agriculture. With advances in next-generation sequencing and many other high-throughput technologies, worldwide soybean researchers have generated and made available a massive amount of complex multi-disciplinary datasets. These datasets provide an unprecedented opportunity to discover new traits and their causative genes and alleles, infer gene networks and build effective phenotypic prediction models that are critical for modern soybean improvement.  My laboratory has been working on establishing a big-data driven, interdisciplinary technology platform by consolidating the in-house generated with open-access, diverse and massive amount of data. We have been developing a suite of data analysis, mining tools and strategies for translating the continuously increasing large datasets into improved soybean cultivars.SCINet Note: SCINet, since its inception, has been an integral part of our large-scale data driven research. Overall, SCINet has enabled us to effectively produce more than 50 TB of soybean -omics data for mining. Using SCINet’s high performance computing clusters (HPCs; Ceres and/or Atlas), we consolidated and analyzed over 5,000 whole-genome sequences and 3,920 transcriptomes of soybean, which were generated in our laboratory or were available in the public domain.  This venture resulted in a large-scale, expandable, and user-friendly genomic resource constituting structurally and functionally annotated  32 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 3.3 million DNA structural variants (SVs) in 1,562 diverse soybean accessions. The transcriptome analyses delineated transcript accumulation of 56,000 soybean genes from 1,438 distinct biological treatments. Collectively, these datasets are of immense utility to research community and thus, a complete annotated SNPs dataset has been released in Ag Data Commons (An et al. 2020) and Soybase. A comprehensive description of the dataset and its versatile use will be published (Zhang et al. under review).SCINet has provided access to pre-installed tools and software along with the capacity to download and install our own user-specific tools, which enables us to effectively develop a suite of new data analysis pipelines/ data-mining strategies. SCINet was also instrumental in our discovery of the genes underlying two large-effect protein and oil QTLs, which soybean researchers attempted to clone in past three decades, and demonstrating their key roles in soybean domestication (Zhang, et al. 2020).References:An Y-qC, Zhang H, Meryer R. 2020.

Melanie completed her PhD in Ecology at Penn State University where she studied landscape and climate drivers of Wild Bee Communities. She leads the SCINet Pollinator Working Group.Flowers provide critical nectar and pollen resources to support foraging, learning and memory, and reproduction of pollinating insects, but there are very few large-scale maps of floral resources for pollinators. As part of my post-doctoral research supported by SCINet, I am developing a data-driven method to map floral resources at large geographic extents by scaling-up field observations of plant communities. My colleagues and I are integrating previously disparate datasets that describe ‘who, when, where, and how much’ flowering occurs in 23 habitat types in the Northeast USA.Our approach is unique because it generates relatively fine-scale temporal predictions of floral area over large spatial extents, relevant for apicultural, agricultural, and conservation decisions. With this large, integrated dataset on flowering, for a given location in the Northeast, we can estimate monthly (or even weekly) quantities of flowers available for pollinators across a landscape. Some wild-bee species are active for a very short segment of the growing season but forage up to 1-5km from their nests (or more in times of resource scarcity), necessitating a combination of fine temporal and broad spatial data. This work will enable researchers, land owners, and conservation professionals to identify temporal and spatial gaps in available flowers and design pollinator plantings to mitigate resource scarcity (recently highlighted as federal research priority in the 2021 USDA Annual Strategic Pollinator Priorities and Goals Report.SCINet note: Our team used SCINet’s Atlas HPC to create national habitat maps that we could combine with field surveys to map floral area. This workflow involved merging two pre-existing habitat maps (USDA NASS Cropland Data Layer with the LANDFIRE National Vegetation Classification). Using the Atlas ‘big memory’ nodes, we completed the geospatial merge for the conterminous United States in less than one day which will allow us to create annual habitat maps for multiple years (2010-2020 expected output)."

  "content" : "Rising global temperatures have cascading effects on Earth’s agro-ecosystems. To better understand and contextualize these effects, we leveraged the long records of observational and experimental data collected across a suite of sites in the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network, including 2 Long Term Agroecosystem Research sites. Debra Peters and I organized a large team of researchers from eight dryland sites across a wide geographic and production gradient (shown by images above). Drylands receive low amounts of rainfall, and plants at these sites are limited in how much they can grow by the amount of water available. Warming amplifies water limitations at these sites, and increases the frequency and intensity of wildfires, dust, and flooding events. We highlight and compare the importance of these multiple drivers to primary production with feedbacks to global climate in an upcoming issue in BioScience special. Kellogg Biological Station and Jornada Experimental Range are two sites from this study that are also part of the 18-site Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) Network.Climate can also drive the spatial spread of livestock disease, such as Vesicular Stomatitis (VS), that I am studying with the VSV Grand Challenge group, whose multi-disciplinary members include ARS scientists Debra Peters, Luis Rodriguez, Lee Cohnstaedt, Barbara Drolet, Justin Derner, and Emile Elias along with our collaborator from USDA APHIS, Angela Pelzel-McCluskey. The virus, VSV, enters the US from Mexico every few years and then spreads to cover much of the western US with a tendency towards regions that are cooler and wetter the following year. These results are consistent with the characteristics of habitat conditions and life-cycles of the black flies and biting midges insect vectors for this disease. Large-scale modes of climate variability, such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), can drive changes in regional climate to influence the location and timing of VSV across the Mexico border. The SCINet HPC resources allow us to use a large number of datasets (&gt;400) in AI frameworks towards better prediction of the spread of VSV as a model for predictive disease ecology across the US."

  "content" : "All plant and animal species must interact with microbes to survive and thrive. Examples of these interactions include the symbiosis of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in plant roots or the presence of beneficial microbes in the gastrointestinal tracts of animals. Even slight changes in microbial systems can have substantial effects on animal and plant productivity.The study of all microbial genomes in a system is called “metagenomics.” Many agriculturally relevant metagenomes are incredibly complex and can have more unique DNA sequences than their plant or animal host. The amount of any one microbial species may vary from sample to sample, making it hard to identify and characterize species that may be present at very low levels. It is also difficult to resolve a “core” genome for each microbial species because the genome is constantly changing due to the transfer of DNA from one microbial species to another,  a phenomenon known as “horizontal gene transfer”. Despite these issues, recent advances in technology have made metagenome assembly and characterization much more practical.Improved length and quality of DNA sequence “reads” provide the best resolution of complex microbial genomes. Recent improvements in a technology known as “circular consensus sequencing” (CCS), by the company PacBio, have resulted in reads that are longer than 5,000 bases and have error rates less than 1% per base content. Previous error rates were 15-17%. While this error correction may not seem substantial, the reliability of CCS reads allows us to confidently detect low-level microbial strains in a sample. Since each read is derived from a single DNA molecule, there are several interesting biological facts about microbial genome structure that we can investigate using CCS technology. For example, we can detect certain types of horizontal gene transfer events that have integrated into microbial genomes on a single-molecule basis. This can include the detection of viruses that infect specific strains of microbes by identifying specific cells where viral genetic information has been integrated into the host genome. All of these analyses are incredibly complex and require sifting through mountains of data, so researchers at ARS need high-performance computing to be able to identify these features within a reasonable timeframe.SCINet Note: The Ceres cluster has been instrumental in our attempts to characterize agricultural metagenomes by providing the computational power necessary for each project. A complicated metagenome can require over 100 billion bases of DNA sequence to be generated in order to identify a large majority of the microbes in the system. These billions of bases of DNA are spread among hundreds of millions of DNA sequence reads, which are akin to puzzle pieces of their original microbial genomes. To recreate the original genome from these pieces, we use computer algorithms to compare them all against each other. Just like a complex jigsaw puzzle, we can identify some pieces that naturally fit together and then stitch them all together into a larger portion of the puzzle. Imagine, though, that you have hundreds of millions of pieces and have no idea how the end result should look! We calculated that if we used just one CPU processor core, it would take more than a year for our algorithm to assemble the final metagenome from one of our samples. Using the distributed computing power of the Ceres cluster, we can reduce that time down to several days, leaving us with more time to analyze the results for interesting biological information. Already, the methods we have developed have been used by the research community and have been recognized with a 2020 Federal Laboratory Consortium for Technology Transfer (FLC) Midwest Regional Award for outstanding research."

  "content" : "As a scientist in USDA-ARS’s Animal Genomics and Improvement Lab, one of our missions is to generate scientific resources used to improve our ability to raise cattle, sheep and goats to their fullest potential. We have sequencing technologies that can be used to sequence the DNA of these animals and generate a blueprint of their genomes. A genome consists of long strings of DNA called chromosomes. The problem we face is that the sequencing technologies can’t sequence full chromosomes, but rather they sequence millions of pieces of DNA or fragments of the chromosome that have to be pieced together like a puzzle using HPCs (high performance computer [HPC] clusters).My main focus is to improve the accuracy and completeness of reference genome that are then used to, for example, search for disease-causing mutations or breed for a beneficial trait like milk production. Our most recent cattle genome that we pieced together had more unbroken chromosomes compared to the more highly fragmented (contigs) previous reference genome for cattle (see above image; Rosen et al. 2020, GigaScience). This more complete genome might have DNA that was missed in earlier assembled genomes and is important to researchers studying large-scale chromosome biology and its role in gene regulation. For example, we know that different breeds possess novel sequences and variation in how the chromosomes are arranged that are difficult or impossible to detect in a single reference genome based upon a single breed (Low et al. 2020, Nature Communications). Multiple assembled genomes are expanding the range of genetic diversity we are able to interrogate. Our ultimate goal is to incorporate all known genetic diversity into a single reference for each species called a pan-genome. This will require significant super computing resources that are only possible thanks to SCINet.SCINet note: Not all genomes are assembled equally. Genome size and complexity have an enormous impact on the computational time required for assembly. The HPCs available through SCINet, named Ceres and Atlas, allow our research group to put together the pieces of DNA using different parameters of the program we use to determine the best possible solution. SCINet is a shared computing resource where users can purchase access to the HPC, but are able to use way more than they could afford for short periods of time. This approach has enabled us to triple our compute capacity without increasing the burden on cost or local IT resources. SCINet also has amazing staff that support the machines, software installation and domain experts as part of the Virtual Research Support Core (VRSC). This in-house ARS capacity is essential because we can now accomplish objectives that would never have been possible before."

  "content" : "Scientists of many disciplines, including agricultural fields, often use climate change projections in their research. For example, these projections have been used to estimate how crops or ecological systems may be impacted by future climate conditions, or to predict the spread of diseases and pests. Many sources of climate change projections exist for these research applications: over 100 different global general circulations models (GCMs) in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) archives; large ensembles generated from a single GCM (such as NCAR’s CESM large ensemble); dynamically downscaled GCM products that generate higher spatial resolution information using regional climate models (such as CORDEX); and statistically downscaled GCM products that generate higher resolution information using empirical equations (such as the MACA product). Unfortunately, there are no quality standards or model performance thresholds implemented for any of this data. How should a scientist choose the most appropriate and robust source of projections for their particular research application considering the many sources and varied quality of available data?The best practice is to spend time evaluating the performance of climate model simulations using metrics that are relevant to each particular research application and to then avoid the use of climate projections from any model that doesn’t perform well. In other words, a scientist should ensure that a model can simulate, fairly realistically, the phenomenon of interest/impact before using its projections. This applies to “bias-corrected” downscaled products as well as GCMs because 1) a poorly performing model shouldn’t be downscaled in the first place and 2) many model biases exist but only a couple are corrected in the downscaling process.In reality though, this best practice is almost never followed due to the time, computational resources, and evaluation knowledge required for a model performance analysis. Instead, scientists often select one of the many available downscaled GCM products and use a multi-model average of projections, without considering the implications of model bias. For any domain scientist (outside of climate science) this is completely understandable. What ecologist, hydrologist, or rangeland scientist wants to spend months assessing the quality of climate models when they could grab a single climate projection product and instead spend that time focusing on cropland, hydrology, or rangeland science questions? We must work toward a model evaluation solution that produces more robust science while also being much more convenient and understandable for scientists to implement.As part of my SCINet postdoctoral fellowship, I am working with members of the USDA-ARS Vesicular Stomatitis (VS) grand challenge project to determine the most robust climate model projections for predicting changes in the geographic range of the livestock disease, VS, under future climate conditions (forthcoming article in the journal Climate). As part of this Grand Challenge Project, ARS scientists Debra Peters, Luis Rodriguez, Lee Cohnstaedt, Barbara Drolet, Justin Derner, and Emile Elias along with our collaborator from USDA APHIS, Angela Pelzel-McCluskey are developing process-based early warning strategies to predict the spread of vector-borne disease across the US. My research will improve those predictions through a more objective approach to selecting climate data driving the spread of disease. Our experience with this project will have application to other agricultural problems where scientists need to select the climate change model projections for their research.I am a climate scientist trained in climate model evaluation and selection for research and decision making applications. During my time as a postdoc at USDA, I plan to work on a range of projects to evaluate climate model performance and to assist in selection of climate projections for specific research applications. Eventually, I plan to develop a web-hosted tool for selecting robust model projections using the results and knowledge gained from these analyses. For scientists who are currently evaluating model performance, this tool will save countless research hours. For scientists who are not looking at model performance before selecting climate projections, this tool will provide more robust results.I am currently working with the VS Grand Challenge group but am looking for additional collaborations. Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you are interested in collaborating!"

  "content" : "The damage that insect pests cost to human health and agriculture is enormous. For instance, invasive insects cost a minimum of US$70.0 billion per year globally, while associated health costs can exceed US$6.9 billion per year. One method that can help control insect pests is the study of pest insect genomes, because insect genomic data are useful resources for developing alternative and eco‐friendly pest control policies.  Such analyses allow entomologists to discover molecular diversity in insect populations that underlie the causes of pest population outbreaks. But many of the existing insect genome sequences are not of high quality, which means that critical functional data may not be present in these genomes. Until recently, sequencing costs made it impractical to sequence large numbers of genomes, so that the genomes of many insect pests have yet to be sequenced.However, technologies for cheaper, more high-quality genome assemblies are emerging, including the application of PacBio HiFi reads. These single-molecule long reads are processed as circular, consensus sequencing (CCS) reads to generate relatively long single molecule reads (5-20kb+) with exceptionally high accuracy. This technology improves the quality and completeness of genome sequences to capture more contiguous (i.e., not separated by gaps) DNA sequences than older sequencing technologies. Through performing DNA extraction and library preparation in my lab in Hilo, HI, and collaborating with PacBio Sequel II sequencing platforms available within the agency (Stoneville, MS &amp; Clay Center, NE), we generated HiFi data for a number of insect pests as part of the Ag100Pest sequencing initiative.Despite the small physical size and relatively low DNA yield of many insect species, which can inhibit DNA sequencing, we used library preparation methods adapted for low (as low as ~250 ng) and ultralow (as low as 5 ng) DNA quantities, allowing us to generate whole-genome data from single insects. Therefore, despite the low amount of input DNA, we are still able to generate extremely contiguous assemblies that allow us to test several different diploid genome assemblers developed for HiFi reads (HiCanu, HiFiASM, IPA).Even for relatively complex genomes of non-model insects (insects that are not closely related to well studied species), we can build highly accurate assemblies. In some cases, contiguous DNA sequences spanning entire chromosomes or chromosome arms, and accurate resolution of repeat regions including centromere and telomere components have been possible.Another great advantage of this strategy for genome assembly is the extremely short assembly time and relatively low computational requirements to complete the assembly. On a single node of the Ceres system using standard memory requirements, a 500 Mb genome can be assembled in a few hours using the HiFiASM assembler. HiCanu and IPA required somewhat longer compute times, and HiCanu required multiple compute nodes, but all were significantly shorter than previous assemblies with “standard” PacBio CLR data. Additionally, sequencing coverage as low as 20X was able to yield these outcomes, although there is some benefit to sequencing at high coverage, up to 60X was shown to generate improvements in contiguity. By combining these assemblies with HiC data, we have been able to scaffold to chromosome dozens of insect genome, and in many cases, the contiguity of the input HiFi assembly to the HiC scaffolding was already near chromosome scale, and the HiC data serves more to validate the correctness of the assemble, rather than join hundreds of contigs into chromosomes as seen in previous assembly technologies. Through these advances in genome sequencing and assembly methods, hundreds of reference quality assemblies can be performed on Ceres or Atlas each year to meet the needs of researchers across the agency.SCINet Note: This project utilized computational resources on the Ceres HPC. Pipelines for performing pre-assembly filtering, HiFi assembly, post-assembly scaffolding with HiC and final assembly filtering (to remove microbial and mitochondrial components) have been developed by the Ag100Pest assembly team, and now due to the resources available on Ceres, we can go from raw data to assembly in less than a day, and curation to final genome in less than a week (requiring some manual review of the final assembly). This is revolutionary to non-model genomics, and allows expansion of the scope of projects into pan-genome studies, strain level characterizations, and more."

  "content" : "A fundamental need to meet USDA ARS’s Grand Challenge initiative is to improve agricultural production while reducing the impact of the emerging pests, pathogens, and invasive species that threaten US livestock. Pathogens such as West Nile Virus (WNV), Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), and others impair livestock health, deplete veterinary resources, and threaten agricultural trade. To better anticipate and prepare for future disease outbreaks caused by viruses, it is essential to model the virus-vector-host interactions and environmental factors that drive disease spread across geographic space and through time. Because disease models must provide high-resolution outputs across expansive geographic extents while simultaneously accounting for the correlations that exist in input variables in both the temporal and spatial dimensions, analyses are often too computationally demanding for traditional hardware and necessitate use of high-performance computing resources like those available through SCINet.As part of the ARS Predictive Disease Ecology Grand Challenge Project led by Drs. Deb Peters and Luis Rodriguez, a spatiotemporal disease model was developed to forecast future West Nile Disease (WND) outbreaks in horses across the continental US. Postdoc Dr. John Humphreys led the analysis to predict the distribution and timing of future WND outbreaks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) records provided the count of veterinary-reported WND cases for horses between 2000 – 2018 aggregated by county. The team used the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service database to map horse populations, incorporated CDC mosquito surveillance reports to identify insect vector ranges, and analyzed more than 10 million bird occurrence records from the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology to map the distributions of avian species known to host WNV. These datasets allowed the model to link the at-risk livestock population (horses) to times and locations with both the WNV reservoirs (birds) and the WNV vectors (mosquitos) that transmit the virus between those reservoirs and livestock. The research team applied a Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework to construct the model and specified that the prediction for any one location be dependent on the disease risk estimated for surrounding areas and past times (manuscript is in preparation).SCINet Note: After 24 hours of processing on a laptop (Intel Core Processor i9-8950HK, 8 Core, 2.9GHz), the model was only approximately 20% completed, with multiple model versions to be run. Conversely, running the model on the Ceres HPC completed in less than 10 hours, dramatically reducing the processing time and freeing up the laptop for other uses. Preparation for running the model on Ceres entailed uploading the existing R script and model input data (using Globus), creating a text file specifying the number of nodes, cores, and memory needed, and then submitting that file to the Ceres job scheduler and management system (Slurm). The team opted to double what was available on their laptop and requested two nodes each with 8 cores. Conveniently, the R package used to run the model (r-INLA) included native multithreading (OpenMP) to handle parallel processing and allowed HPC cores to run concurrently."

Phenology, or timing of seasonal events (in this case for plants), is the product of the different abiotic drivers and is thus a vital metric to study. Remotely sensed data, such as satellite images, are key to tracking land surface phenology. This project seeks to use well-established phenology metrics to quantify scaling relationships between multiple remote platforms such as eddy-covariance towers, near-surface digital cameras or PhenoCams (see figure), and satellite imagery at diverse U.S. agroecosystem sites as part of the ARS Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) network.The working group, led by Dawn Browning, includes ARS researchers as well as multiple University collaborators and was formed in 2019 with an inaugural workshop in Las Cruces, NM to devise collaborative workflows on the SCINet high performance computing (HPC) system, Ceres. The group convenes monthly for teleconferences led by Dr. Browning and plans to convene an annual workshop for the length of the project. The first presentation of the group’s research was presented at the 2019 AGU Fall Meeting in a talk titled “Phenology in U.S. agroecosystems – Integrating data from the Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) Network” and on-going collaborative efforts are underway.Currently, the group is evaluating the performance of a coupled vegetation-hydrological model that uses PhenoCam data as a proxy for primary productivity. The first formal report from this project effort will be submitted for peer review this summer.SCINet Note: We use CERES to build models to forecast future trends in grassland productivity. Model building is an extremely resource intensive operation. We must test millions of combinations of parameters affecting plant, soil, and environmental interactions to identify the best combination to apply to future climate scenarios. With CERES, we can iterate through different models in hours rather than the weeks it would take on desktop computers."

  "content" : "Influenza A viruses (IAV) that circulate in North American pigs maintain a high degree of diversity determined by the hemagglutinin (HA) gene, especially those of the H1 subtype. Genetic diversity is further increased by the bidirectional transmission of IAV between swine and humans and the subsequent processes of antigenic shift and drift. Such evolution can be the basis for changes in antigenic properties of IAV that lead to vaccine failure. Here, we characterized the genetic and antigenic evolution of contemporary swine H1N1 and H1N2 viruses. We compiled a comprehensive dataset of more than 3000 HA genes, and applied Bayesian phylodynamic methods to infer how immune selection, and changes in viral population size, impacted genetic and antigenic diversity. We achieved these analyses using 1-2 dedicated nodes on Ceres, with jobs taking 5-10 days to complete. Our data revealed contrasting patterns of evolution across the known H1 genetic lineages: while the classical swine H1 viruses evolved within established genetic clades, the human-seasonal swine H1 viruses rapidly diversified into three antigenically distinct genetic clades. Further characterization revealed that a few key amino acid mutations were associated with antigenic divergence. The continued genetic and antigenic evolution of contemporary H1 viruses has resulted in vaccines with reduced efficacy, and the observed genetic and antigenic diversity represents a challenge to public health initiatives that attempt to minimize swine-to-human IAV transmission.Ceres Note: We used 1-2 dedicated nodes on Ceres, run times ranged from 5-10 days (i.e., we used medium/long queues). The advantage here is our prior jobs used CIPRES (max run time of 168 hours/7 days).Citation: Rajao, D.S., Anderson, T.K., Kitikoon, P., Stratton, J., Lewis, N.S., Vincent, A.L. 2018.

There are 7365717 records in the fit data spread over 158 partitions. Fit a Kmeans model Here we will fit two different implimentations of the KMeans cluster. The first version (est1) uses a parallel implimentation of the KMEANS algorithm. It is an iterative method, so time to convergence is quite variable. The second method (est2) uses a minibatch approach. Each partition fits the model sequentially, and then models results are combined. This approach uses the scikit-learn package, and then is wrapped with dask_ml ParallelPostFit so the resulting model can be applied to the entire dataset (prediction) in a distributed manner. The same methods can apply to any scikit-learn model that impliments a partial fit method. #Define the estimator (from dask-learn library - iterative method) est1 = KMeans() #Fit the model and time s = time.time() k1 = est1.fit(d_train) print('Total time to complete fitting the model: '+str(round((time.time()-s)/60.,2))+' minutes') Total time to complete fitting the model: 7.62 minutes #Define the estimator (from scikit-learn library) and wrap with Dask Functions est2 = ParallelPostFit(Incremental(MiniBatchKMeans(n_clusters=8,compute_labels=False))) #Fit the model and time s = time.time() k2 = est2.fit(d_train) print('Total time to complete fitting the model: '+str(round((time.time()-s)/60.,2))+' minutes') Total time to complete fitting the model: 0.72 minutes Predict and Visualize We can use either model (k1 or k2) to predict on the entire dataset. #Reshape ALL the data from 3d (x,y,wavelength) to 2d (x*y,wavelength) d_final = d_all.reflectance.data.reshape((-1,len(band_list()[0]))).rechunk(('auto',-1)) #Transform the data with the same scaler as used with the fitting d_final = scaler.transform(d_final) #Predict the cluster for the entire domain, and then transform back to a 3d dataarray (x,y,wavelength) s = time.time() f_shape=xr.open_zarr('/project/geospatial_tutorials/tutorial_1/data/neon_2017_mosaic_brdf_corr.zarr',group='reflectance').reflectance.shape d_kmeans = k1.predict(d_final).persist().reshape(f_shape[0:2]) wait(d_kmeans) print('Total time to predict the entire domain: '+str(round((time.time()-s)/60.,2))+' minutes') Total time to predict the entire domain: 1.28 minutes #Convert results to xarray data base_dat=xr.open_zarr('/project/geospatial_tutorials/tutorial_1/data/neon_2017_mosaic_brdf_corr.zarr',group='reflectance') d_final2=xr.DataArray(data=d_kmeans,coords={'x':base_dat.coords['x'].values,'y':base_dat.coords['y'].values},dims=('y','x')).to_dataset(name='kmean_clust') #Plot the results for the entire domain at a 1/(10*10) resolution plt.figure(figsize=(16,12)) d_final2.isel(x=slice(None,None,10),y=slice(None,None,10)).kmean_clust.plot() &lt;matplotlib.collections.QuadMesh at 0x2ad73d757f98&gt; #Close-up plot of the results plt.figure(figsize=(16,12)) d_final2.isel(x=slice(5000,6000,1),y=slice(5000,6000,1)).kmean_clust.plot() &lt;matplotlib.collections.QuadMesh at 0x2ad73d753198&gt; "

  "content" : "Efficient data practices, using JupyterHub and Lab on Ceres, using Dask for parallel computing Reducing Data Size Data Type Scaling and changing the data type is an effective way to reduce the overall size of your data. A common datatype is floating point 64 bit, which has a level of precision that is often far greater than the precision in the data. Consider reflectance data ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 in floating point representation. Scaling by 10,000, and converting to int16 (16 bits) perserves the precision of the data and can reduce the size by a factor of 4. Consider the Below Example: import numpy as np array1 = np.random.random((1000,10000)).astype(np.float64) print(‘This array, in ‘+str(array1.dtype)+’, is ‘+str(array1.nbytes1e-6)+’ MB’) array2 = np.round(array110000.,0).astype(np.int16) print(‘Scaling and converting the array to ‘+str(array2.dtype)+’ results in a size of ‘+str(array2.nbytes*1e-6)+’ MB’) This array, in float64, is 80.0 MB Scaling and converting the array to int16 results in a size of 20.0 MB Data Compression Most raster formats have internal lossless compression options. Depending on the nature of your data, this can reduce the size substantially. For detailed specifications of raster formats see the GDAL specifications. Other common file formats, such as Zarr (Zarr Compression) and NetCDF (NetCDF Compression) have internal compression options as well. Virtual Rasters A common issue with geospatial analysis is working with data in different projections. A typical workflow may be to reproject data into a common projection, which results in duplication. An alternative is to use Virtual Raster Files (.VRT), which a simple .xml files that describe how the data should be transformed when opened. In addition to re-projecting, Virtual Raster Files can be used to mosaic, alter resolutions, resample, etc… An efficient tool for building VRT files is gdalbuildvrt  Python Setup Overall Setup - Background Interface JupyterLab: Web-based user interface (IDE for Python, R, IDL, etc…) JupyterHub A multi-user Hub that spawns, manages, and proxies multiple instances of the single-user Jupyter notebook server Packages / Resouces Dask: Parallel Computing Library Xarray: Labelled multi-dimensional array package Numpy: Fundamental package for scientific computing with Python Rasterio: Raster IO and processing. Pangeo : NSF funded project for Big Data Geoscience. Implements a system very similiar to the container used on Ceres (titled: data_science_im_rs) EarthML: Examples of machine learning and visualization for Earth science. Supported and maintained by Anaconda, as a collaboration with the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Cluster Dask Distributed (a python library for parallel and distributed computing) uses Direct Acyclic Graphs to distribute data and processing across the cluster (very different from a MPI style cluster). Components of a dask cluster include: Client Scheduler Workers Container Singularity Container which can be found on Docker Hub Location URL: docker://rowangaffney/data_science_im_rs:latest Modified from the data_science docker stack Thanks to Yasasvy (Yash) Nanyam (Scinet VRSC) for helping getting it working Github: https://github.com/rmg55/data_science_im_rs/blob/master/data_science_im_rs Dockerhub: https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/rowangaffney/data_science_im_rs/general Step by Step Instructions Below are the steps/commands to setup the Python/JupyterLab environment followed by a soundless video of the process on Ceres. Note that you will need to already have a SCINet account. Please visit the SCINet website for detailed instructions to setup an account. Access JupyterHub Currently, to access JupyterHub, you need to port forward the application to your local system. However, in the future there will be a public URL, and you will not longer need to do this step. To port forward JupyterHub, run the following command in the PowerShell (windows) or terminal (linux). Note that you will need to replace your USER.NAME with your SciNET user name. ssh -N -L 8000:jupyterhub.scinet.local:80 USER.NAME@login.scinet.science Open in Browser Open a web browser (firefox, chrome, edge, etc…) and go to localhost:8000 Spawn JupyterLab Once logged into JupyterHub, you are given a set of options when launching JupyterLab. Below are brief descriptions of each option, followed by the value to use for this tutorial. If this is the first time spawning a notebook from a container on Docker or Singularity Hub (as in this example), it will take 4-10 minutes to donwload and build the container. The container is then cached in your home directory, so on subsequent tries, JupyterLab should spawn in 10 - 30 seconds. Node Type: Ceres partition to use when running JupyterLab       short OR brief-low (ethier works) Number of Cores: Number of Cores to allocate       4 Job Duration: Length of Job (HH:MM:SS)       00:30:00 Additional Slurm Options: Sbatch Options       (leave blank) Notebook/Lab Options: Additional JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook options       –notebook-dir=/project/geospatial_tutorials/ Enter the full path to the container image: Location of the container to use       docker://rowangaffney/data_science_im_rs:latest Container Exec Options: Additional options for the singularity exec command       –bind /etc/munge –bind /var/log/munge –bind /var/run/munge –bind /usr/bin/squeue –bind /usr/bin/sinfo –bind /usr/bin/scancel –bind /usr/bin/sbatch –bind /usr/bin/scontrol –bind /scinet01/gov/usda/ars/scinet/system/slurm:/etc/slurm –bind /run/munge –bind /usr/lib64 –bind /scinet01 –bind $HOME –bind /software/7/apps/envi -H $HOME:/home/jovyan Please be cognizant of the compute resources you are requesting (see best practices below). Best Practices For short sessions (2hrs or less) please choose the brief-low partition in the Node Type drop down, if available. For serial computing (non-parallel code) enter 2 or 4 for number of cores. For parallel computing choose a reasonable number of cores to meet your needs. Choose a reasonable job duration (e.g. Do not choose 48hr job duration so you can leave your session open overnight). Remember to stop the jupyter server when you are done working (file –&gt; Hub Control Panel –&gt; Stop Server). Note that this data_science_im_rs container has two main environments which include (as of March 18, 2020): ► geo (python geospatial - click to see all packages) ► r_geo (R geospatial - click to see all packages) Furthermore, you can launch the RStudio (which uses the r_geo environment), a terminal, a help window, markdown, text file, and IDL kernel. To access the IDL library, you need to check-out the license from SCINet license server and bind-mounted properly (this is not shown in this example). The following silent video is a media alternative for the text in steps 1-3 in the Python Setup Section above. Link To Video  Cluster Setup Overall Setup - Background Uses the Dask Jobqueue Library to submit jobs to SLURM. Each Slurm job has X number of Python workers. Scales across nodes and partitions. Number of workers can be scaled up or down dynamically. Subject to SLURM resource allocation. JupyterLab has a Dask add-on to monitor the cluster. Dask includes a Dataframe (ie: Pandas) and Array (ie: Numpy) equivalent features. Dask Dataframes Dask Array Dask is used by Xarray - a geospatial/multidimensionial data package. Step by Step Instructions Below are the steps/commands to setup the cluster. Below these steps is a gif of the process on Ceres.

  "content" : "Performing QTL-seq data processing on CeresWhat is QTL-seq?Bulk segregant analysis (BSA) is used to find genes by identifying biased allele frequencies between two population that have been pooled based on distinctive phenotypes.  The technique has historically been limited by the qualitative nature of older genotyping platforms.  Next-generation sequencing allows for more precise characterization of allele frequencies in a population. This capacity was first realized in yeast studies, where extremely large populations sizes (&gt;100,000) individuals were used and extreme individuals within the population were pooled and resequenced (Ehrenreich et al., 2010).  Plant researchers quickly attempted to apply the above approach, commonly referred to as “QTL-seq”, to quantitative traits such as cold-tolerance (Yang et al., 2013), fungal rice blast (Takagi et al., 2013), and wheat grain protein (Trick et al., 2012), among others.  Though much of the work in QTL-seq is in the field and lab, the last portion does require bioinformatics.  To that end, we provide the following work-flow.Getting everything ready to run this pipeline(aka: things I won’t discuss how to do)   Get sequencing data on Ceres and in a working directory   Combine reads across sequencing lanes, if needed   Create and run job scripts Processing raw reads to get allele depth in each bulkSequencing data for each bulk should be mapped to a reference genome using bowtie or bwa with appropriate parameters.  A plausible job script might look something like this:#!/bin/bash  #SBATCH --job-name=qtl_seq #SBATCH -p short #SBATCH -N 1 #SBATCH -n 40 #SBATCH -t 48:00:00 #SBATCH --mail-user=your.email@usda.gov #SBATCH --mail-type=BEGIN,END,FAIL #SBATCH -o stdout.%j.%N #SBATCH -e stderr.%j.%N  module load bwa module load samtools  #map reads from low bulk sample bwa mem -t 40 reference.fasta lowBulk_R1.fastq.gz lowBulk_R2.fastq.gz | samtools view - bS - | samtools sort - &gt; lowBulk.sort.bam samtools index lowBulk.sort.bam  #map reads from high bulk sample bwa mem -t 40 reference.fasta highBulk_R1.fastq.gz highBulk_R2.fastq.gz | samtools view - bS - | samtools sort - &gt; highBulk.sort.bam samtools index highBulk.sort.bam  #End of file Call variants and add information about the allele frequency in each sample:#!/bin/bash  #SBATCH --job-name=qtl_seq #SBATCH -p short #SBATCH -N 1 #SBATCH -n 40 #SBATCH -t 48:00:00 #SBATCH --mail-user=your.email@usda.gov #SBATCH --mail-type=BEGIN,END,FAIL #SBATCH -o stdout.%j.%N #SBATCH -e stderr.%j.%N  module load samtools module load bcftools  #map reads to reference.fa using bwa or bowtie to generate highBulk.bam and lowBulk.bam samtools faidx reference.fasta #creates index samtools mpileup -g -t AD -f reference.fasta highBulk.sort.bam lowBulk.sort.bam &gt; output.bcf #calls variants and adds fequency information bcftools call -vc -V indels output.bcf &gt; output_snps.bcf #filter to snps #The inclusion of repeats in your experiment can dramatically reduce your signal strength; therefore, poor mapping quality and excess depth of coverage are two key features to filter on.  So the next step is optional but something like it is highly recommended bcftools filter -i 'MQ&gt;50 &amp;&amp; DP&gt;5 &amp;&amp; DP&lt;60' -O b output_snps.bcf &gt; filt_output_snps.bcf bcftools convert filt_output_snps.bcf -O z -o output_snps.vcf.gz #convert to compressed VCF Examining differential frequency of alleles visually and identifying peak genomic regionsFrom this point, it may be worthwile to download your resultant compressed VCF file and then run processing and viewing programs locally. Alternatively, you can also use RStudio on Ceres as documented in the auxiliary section below Using Rstudio on Scinet CERES in 3 steps.We focus on a QTL-seq analysis software called QTLSurge. Many others exist, such as QTLseqr.  Importantly, these other programs may not be completely compatible with the pipeline we have described above.QTLsurge is designed to be run under RStudio as a Shiny app and requires some dependent libraries. These are already installed on Ceres, so you can skip step 1 if working on Ceres:   Install dependencies: RStudio then, using Rstudio package manager, install zoo, ggplot2, and shiny libraries.   Download the programs: QTLsurge.R and vcf2freq.pl from QTLsurge and put in an appropriate folder.   Open QTLsurge.R in RStudio   Press “Run App” button   If using a Windows machine (not Ceres), you may also have to install Perl. QTLsurge requires a tab delimited file containing chromosome ID in the first column, SNP location in the second column, high-bulk allele frequency in the third column, low-bulk allele frequency in the fourth column, deltaSNP (difference between high and low frequency) value in the fifth column, and cycle number in sixth column (see test/test.freq). Regardless of sign, all deltaSNP values are converted to absolute values for plotting and window calculation.A testing file (test/test.freq) is located on the QTLsurge github page. This file demonstrates the required input format and can be used to test that your app is working correctly.Create such a file from the data produced above:gunzip output_snps.vcf.gz #uncompresses as output_snps.vcf and removes output_snps.vcf.gz perl vcf2freq.pl output_snps.vcf 0 &gt;output_frequency_file.txt #vcf2freq.pl is supplied as a helper program, converts to QTLsurge format.  The last argument is the cycle you are on.  Use 0 if this is your initial, standard QTL-seq experiment.  This script is not robust to variation in genotype format and only accepts GT:PL:AD format that results from the pipeline described above. Browse to this file and open it. A graph, similar to the one below will appear momentarily. You can step through each chromosome using the interface and look for peaks that are above the genome-wide threshold (95th percentile based on raw deltaSNP values). Because raw data of this kind is very noisy, a sliding window average is supplied. The appropriate window size is a function of population size, recombination rate, marker density, and read depth. Generally, if read depth is &gt;40x, your window size should decrease as your population size increases. A good rule-of-thumb is that few windows should have an average that extends beyond 3 standard error units of a directly adjacent window, assuming your overlap-to-window-size is ~20%. The red line indicates the average of window and the gray shading indicates 3 standard error units. Note: Setting the overlap size very low will cause QTLSurge to respond slowly and should only be used when zoomed in to a &lt;1MB range.For a standard QTL-seq experiment, this might be a stopping point for publication. QTLsurge provides further support for iterative rounds of genotyping that allow a researcher to further pinpoint genes and/or confirm the peaks that they have discovered. The QTLsurge page describes these possible experiments and analyses in more detail.Using Rstudio on Scinet CERES in 3 stepssee also the RStudio Server User GuideLog into CERES, and run a pre-made Rstudio scriptOpen up two terminals or putty windows (important for later) and use one to connect to &lt;username&gt;@scinet.science. Then, either use the file /reference/containers/RStudio/3.6.0/rstudio.job, or create an Rstudio script using the Ceres Job Script Generator (eAuthentication required).If using the generator, make sure you select “Rstudio” in the “Job Script template” dropdown menu). I recommend copying the /reference/ or generated script into your desired working directory. You should now edit the script to request the time and resources you want. Some R modules, like those for coexpression analysis, need many threads and lots of memory, so you’ll want to edit the “–mem” and “–nodes” lines in the script to request the memory and CPUs you need. Also, for the next step, you may wish to edit the “–output” line to change the default location for the output instructions from /home/&lt;username&gt; to whichever working directory you want. The output instructions will tell you what to do next in detail.Submit the job and read the instructions in the generated rstudio-out fileThe outputted “rstudio-&lt;lots of numbers&gt;.out” file will have instructions on how to connect to your now-running Rstudio session. You can either a) create an ssh tunnel with an  ssh -N -L 8787:hostname:port  command, then open a browser window at “localhost:8787” (you can then minimize the terminal window you used to do the ssh command); or b) connect to the SCINet VPN, and go to the hostname:8787 address indicated in the rstudio.out file in your browser of choice.Log into the Rstudio serverIf you did the above step correctly, your browser should be presenting you with an Rstudio login screen. Following the instructions in the same output file above, log into the server in the browser window using the credentials supplied in that file (your Scinet user name and a randomly-generated one-time password)."

We cannot provide individual assistance for login issues in any other session. Software + Hardware + Nomenclature OverviewThe software discussed and shown in the workshop is largely open source, can run on a desktop, HPC, or cloud environment. Below is a quick overview of some of the software, hardware, and confusing nomenclature that will be used during this workshop.SCINet vs. Ceres vs. AtlasSCINet is the USDA ARS Scientific Computing INitiative that aims to improve access to high performance and cloud computing, improve networking to facilitate high speed data transfer, and facilitate scientific computational training. A part of SCINet is its computing infrastructure, including the Ceres and Atlas high-performance computing (HPC) clusters. For most of the tutorials, we will default to running them on Ceres but session material will provide information about both clusters. For more information on computing systems that SCINet offers, see the Computer Systems page of the SCINet website..Open OnDemandOpen OnDemand (https://openondemand.org) allows end users to use a web browser to access resources with graphical applications at HPCs such as Ceres and Atlas. This workshop will use Open OnDemand on Ceres to access three applications:   RStudio Server: A web-based version of RStudio, an integrated development environment for the language R.   JupyterLab: A web-based interactive development environment which we will use for python.   Desktop: A virtual desktop which we will use to run the QGIS graphical user interface. SLURMSLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) is the workload manager used on the Ceres and Atlas HPC systems to allocate computational resources. From the SLURM documentation, SLURM is “an open source… cluster management and job scheduling system for large and small Linux clusters. As a cluster workload manager, SLURM has three key functions. First, it allocates exclusive and/or non-exclusive access to resources (compute nodes) to users for some duration of time so they can perform work. Second, it provides a framework for starting, executing, and monitoring work (normally a parallel job) on the set of allocated nodes. Finally, it arbitrates contention for resources by managing a queue of pending work.”Scientific Coding Languages - Python and RThe tutorials in this workshop will use both R and Python due to previous working group survey results indicating that most members either use these languages or are interested in learning them."

  "content" : " Agenda    Overview of SCINet resources   Introduce SCINet office, organizing committee, and helpers   Describe past workshops, current goals, and overview of sessions   Lightning presentations on geospatial workflows What is the SCINet Geospatial Research Working Group? See our working group page for general information about the working group.Our main goals are to:   provide continued input on the development of SCINet,   improve the computational capacity of ARS geospatial researchers, and   develop collaborative research projects. The goals of the 2022 workshop are to:   provide hands-on learning on how to modify geospatial research workflows to take advantage of SCINet HPC systems,   foster research efforts that had previously been un-attainable due to technical limitations or inexperience, and   inspire new working group objectives. Review of previous workshops 2019 Workshop (Las Cruces, NM)At the 2019 workshop, we:   heard from ARS scientists about successes and challenges of using SCINet for geospatial analysis,   identified common issues and barriers to using SCINet for geospatial research workflows,   generated recommendations for overcoming these issues/barriers,   created the SCINet Geospatial Research Working Group to follow through with workshop recommendations, and   learned about machine learning, deep learning, and some of the ways ML/DL are being used for research at New Mexico State University and the Jornada Experimental Range. The resulting recommendations for improving access to SCINet HPC/cloud computing and enhancing general computational skill in the ARS geospatial research community are as follows:A) Improve data access, sharing, and storage.   Implement better methods for getting massive input data into the computational environment.   Build/expand higher speed connections to SCINet.   Build a common data library on SCINet to reduce duplication of popular datasets and reduce the barrier to adopting HPC workflows.   Hold trainings in data management for long-term datasets and archiving of data from retired scientists. B) Enhance reproducibility of our science and increase collaboration.   Hold trainings on using Git, containers, and other reproducibility tools.   Hold hands-on group work sessions in R and Python. C) Build capacity for using HPC/cloud computing.   Hold trainings on how to access and compute on the SCINet HPC systems (including how to parallelize code) to reduce the learning curve.   Develop a collection of tutorials from ag/geo-relevant applications with example scripts that run on the SCINet HPCs, including ML/DL techniques. (Geospatial Workbook)   Hire personnel, including postdocs, with multi-disciplinary computational backgrounds.   Hold trainings in R, Python, and Unix through The Carpentries or similar.   Repeat the 2019 AI Training by Adam Rivers and University of Florida collaborators.   Hold trainings in image processing. D) Expand SCINet HPC system software, hardware, and support to focus on our research community needs.   Contract a “GeoTeam” that would help our research community with workflow development, parallelization, and code optimization.   Deploy a better forum for searchable SCINet questions/answers.   Purchase community GPUs when the priority GPU gets to be a limited resource.   Install Pix4D Engine software on SCINet. 2020 Workshop (Virtual)The 2020 Workshop was planned following the key needs identified in the community in 2019 workshop. The workshop opened with short introductions of the first cohort of SCINet postdocs and a discussion on the status and needs for the SCINet geospatial common data library and workbooks. Participants were introduced to the Ceres HPC and worked through several tutorials ranging in complexity from the basic various ways to run jobs on Ceres, to running on clusters in parallel, reproducible research best practices, and a real world example of running an analysis on Ceres. Most of these tutorials were in a Python and JupyterLab framework. The workshop closed with seminars and a panel of researchers in academia and industry discussing their machine learning workflows to improve agricultural practices.Lightning talksWatch a recording of this presentation and lightning talks.

  "content" : " Learning objectives The Geospatial Common Data Library (GeoCDL) is a community-driven product inspired by the computational needs discussions in the previous working group workshops. This effort is motivated by the desire to reduce duplication of effort across ARS scientists in downloading and curating large geospatial datasets, avoid the storage of duplicate data on HPC resources, and lower the barrier of entry to new users interested in leveraging SCINet computing resources to analyze large and complex geospatial data. This session will include tutorials using the pilot version of the GeoCDL on Ceres.   Access the GeoCDL API via the rgeocdl R package   Query the API to list the datasets currently available   Download raster data within an area of interest   Download extracted raster data at points of interest Agenda    Purpose and current status   Interface options   Tutorial 1: Area of interest   Tutorial 2: Points of interest   Discussion: desired datasets and features  Tutorial material Watch a recording of this tutorialA written version of this tutorial, modified to be accessible to any SCINet user, is available on the Geospatial Workbook.

  "description" : "Maintenance",
  "date" : "Monday, August 23 2021",
  "content" : "This maintenance window will be longer than normal as there are several important hardware upgrades occurring during this window to enhance the overall power and capacity of the CERES HPC cluster.  These upgrades include the remaining new priority nodes, sixty eight additional compute nodes, two additional high memory compute nodes, six management nodes, and faster Infiniband switching technology used by the HPC nodes to access storage. VRSC will re-rack and re-wire the whole cluster to accommodate additional hardware while adhering to power and cooling limits.   Queued jobs will not start if they cannot complete by 7AM August 23. These include jobs submitted to the long partition with the default 3-weeks long time limit. In the output of the squeue command the reason for those jobs will state (ReqNodeNotAvail, Reserved for maintenance). The jobs will start after the scheduled outage completes.  The Atlas cluster will stay up and running during Ceres downtime. All Ceres users can run jobs on Atlas. If you don't have a large enough project quota on Atlas, remember that you can use /90daydata on Atlas that has no quotas"

This downtime is to rewire both power and networking on Ceres for the addition of additional compute nodes and to ready it for storage expansion.  We do not anticipate any further extended downtimes for rewiring, as this should allow us to maximize the size of Ceres simply by adding additional compute nodes. Since this affects the Authentication for SCINet, this will also affect logins to Data Transfer nodes at Ames, StoneVille, Fort Collins, Clay Center, Albany CA, and Beltsville.GlobalNoc will also be upgrading software on the SCINet network infrastructure during this time."
