## Learning objectives
<br>
{:.border-bottom}

The overall objective of this session is to provide a foundation in parallel processing terminology and HPC-usage basics before applying these concepts in the upcoming tutorials. Please see the links listed in Session 11 for additional parallel processing training opportunities.

* Define an 'embarassingly parallel' problem
* Apply a parallelization approach flowchart to a geospatial problem
* Describe the basic SLURM job submission parameters
* Identify the appropriate Ceres or Atlas partition for a job

## Agenda
<br>
{:.border-bottom}

This session will be a lecture with slides covering the following content:

* Trade-offs in parallel processing: effort, time, communication
* How to approach parallelization: a geospatial example
  * Determine where in your workflow the most time is spent 
  * Flow chart: parallelization approaches 
  * Choosing number of cores  
* SLURM jobs, nodes, and partitions
