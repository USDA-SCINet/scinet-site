Ceres cluster maintenance is scheduled for February 16-17, 2026.  

Queued jobs will not start if they cannot complete by 6 AM CST on February 16. In the output of the squeue command, the reason for those jobs will state (ReqNodeNotAvail, Reserved for maintenance). The jobs will start after the scheduled outage completes.  

All associated systems (login, dtn, ondemand, compute, storage, etc…) and services (cron, globus access to ceres storage, etc…) will be disabled during this maintenance.  

The Atlas cluster will be available during the Ceres maintenance. We strongly suggest copying data from Ceres to Atlas or Juno prior to the maintenance if you plan to continue working through the maintenance. Once maintenance has started, we will not be able to move your data.  

A notification will be posted on the SCINet Forum and an email will be sent out once the maintenance is complete.  

Please submit any questions you may have via email to [scinet_vrsc@usda.gov](scinet_vrsc@usda.gov).
