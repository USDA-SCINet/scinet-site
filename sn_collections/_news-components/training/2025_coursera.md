The SCINet Office and the AI-COE are excited to provide training opportunities through Coursera. Coursera licenses are available to ARS scientists and support staff for training focused on scientific computing, data science, artificial intelligence, and related topics. Successful completion of courses and specializations result in widely recognized certificates and credentials.

Please visit the [SCINet Coursera Training Page](/training/coursera) to request a license. Licenses will be assigned on a rolling basis and are active for three months. Users may be able to extend their licenses upon request.
