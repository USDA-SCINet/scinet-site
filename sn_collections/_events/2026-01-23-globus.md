Do you have large files on SCINet systems that you would like to share with external collaborators who don't have SCINet accounts? You will soon be able to do this by using Globus, the same web-based interface recommended for other data transfers to, from, and among SCINet systems!  

We will be hosting a webinar Friday, January 23, 2026, 3-4 PM ET to give an overview of what kinds of sharing are supported and a demonstration of how to request and set up file sharing.
