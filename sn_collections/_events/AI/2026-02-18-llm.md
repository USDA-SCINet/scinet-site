Large language models (LLMs), a key technology behind well-known tools like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, have a multitude of applications in agricultural research. SCINet’s high-performance computing resources provide an excellent environment for research use of LLMs, and this workshop will equip you with the knowledge and tools you need to take advantage of LLM capabilities in your research.<!--excerpt-->  

We will explore a variety of use cases, from basic “chat” interactions to more advanced applications, including information retrieval and summarization and high-throughput automation. Along the way, we will learn about how LLMs and related technologies actually work, which will help you make well-informed decisions about how to best use them for your research.  

Ultimately, this workshop will put *you* in the driver's seat: you will be able to decide which models are most appropriate and how to use them, all while ensuring that you remain in full control of your data and results and in compliance with research security requirements.

There are no prerequisites for the first day of the workshop when we will cover introductory concepts and graphical user interfaces, but there are prerequisites for the second day when we will cover automating LLM queries. You may attend only the first day if you wish. If you attend the second day as well, the prerequisites are:  
*  A basic understanding of Python. 
*  An understanding of file system organization and file paths. 
*  Basic command-line skills. E.g., know how to use `ls`, `cd`, and run programs from the command line. 

## Tutorial setup instructions

Steps to prepare for the tutorial:

### Day 1

1. **Login to Atlas Open OnDemand** at [https://atlas-ood.hpc.msstate.edu/](https://atlas-ood.hpc.msstate.edu/). For more information on login procedures for web-based SCINet access, see the [SCINet access user guide]({{site.baseurl}}/guides/access/web-based-login).
1. **Open a command-line session** by clicking on "Clusters" -> "Atlas Shell Access" on the top menu. This will open a new tab with a command-line session on Atlas's login node.
1. **Request resources on a compute node** by running the following command:  
 
    {:.copy-code}
    ```bash
srun -A scinet_workshop2 -t 00:30:00 -n 1 --mem 8G --pty bash
```
    {% include reservation-alert project="scinet_workshop2" %}

1. **Create your workshop working directory** and copy the tutorial materials into it by running the following commands. Note: you do not have to edit the commands with your username as it will be determined by the `$USER` variable.  

    {:.copy-code} 
    ```bash
mkdir -p /90daydata/shared/$USER/llms_on_scinet
cd /90daydata/shared/$USER/llms_on_scinet
cp /project/scinet_workshop2/llms_on_scinet/coding_assistance_jupyterlab.ipynb .
``` 

1. **Setup the kernel for JupyterLab.** You will create a kernel called *venv_llms* to access from JupyterLab Server. Run the following commands to activate the workshop's virtual environment and create a new kernelspec from it: 

    {:.copy-code} 
    ```bash
source /project/scinet_workshop2/llms_on_scinet/venv_llms/bin/activate
ipython kernel install --name "venv_llms" --user
``` 

1. **Stop the interactive job** on the compute node by running the command:

     {:.copy-code} 
    ```bash
exit
``` 

1. **Launch a JupyterLab Server – AI Workshop session.** Under the *Interactive Apps* menu, select *JupyterLab Server – AI Workshop*.
  * Specify the following input values on the page:
      * Partition: atlas
      * Account: scinet_workshop2
      * QoS: normal
      * Number of hours: 3
      * Number of nodes: 1
      * Number of tasks: 1
      * Additional Slurm Parameters:
  
          {: .copy-code } 
          ``` 
--reservation=workshop_llm1
```
        {% include reservation-alert reservation="workshop_llm1" %}

    * Working Directory:  

        {: .copy-code } 
        ``` 
/90daydata/shared/${USER}/llms_on_scinet
``` 

  * Click *Launch*. The screen will update to the *Interactive Sessions* page. When your Jupyter session is ready, the top card will update from *Queued* to *Running* and a *Connect to JupyterLab Server* button will appear. Click *Connect to JupyterLab Server*. 


### Day 2

1. **Login to Atlas Open OnDemand** at [https://atlas-ood.hpc.msstate.edu/](https://atlas-ood.hpc.msstate.edu/). For more information on login procedures for web-based SCINet access, see the [SCINet access user guide]({{site.baseurl}}/guides/access/web-based-login).

1. **Launch a JupyterLab Server – AI Workshop session.** Under the *Interactive Apps* menu, select *JupyterLab Server – AI Workshop*.
  * Specify the following input values on the page:
      * Partition: gpu-a100-mig7
      * Account: scinet_workshop2
      * QoS: normal
      * Number of hours: 4
      * Number of nodes: 1
      * Number of tasks: 3
      * Additional Slurm Parameters:
  
          {: .copy-code } 
          ``` 
--reservation=workshop_llm2 --mem=32GB --gres=gpu:1
```
        {% include reservation-alert reservation="workshop_llm2" %}

    * Working Directory:  

        {: .copy-code } 
        ``` 
/90daydata/shared/${USER}/llms_on_scinet
``` 

  * Click *Launch*. The screen will update to the *Interactive Sessions* page. When your Jupyter session is ready, the top card will update from *Queued* to *Running* and a *Connect to JupyterLab Server* button will appear. Click *Connect to JupyterLab Server*.

1. **Copy the tutorial materials** by opening a terminal within JupyterLab (open the “File” menu, then “New” -> “Terminal”) and running the following commands. Note: you do not have to edit the commands with your username as it will be determined by the `$USER` variable.  

    {:.copy-code} 
    ```bash
cd /90daydata/shared/$USER/llms_on_scinet
cp /project/scinet_workshop2/llms_on_scinet/automating_llm_queries.ipynb .
```
