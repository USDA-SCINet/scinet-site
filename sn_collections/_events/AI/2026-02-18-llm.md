Large language models (LLMs), a key technology behind well-known tools like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, have a multitude of applications in agricultural research. SCINet’s high-performance computing resources provide an excellent environment for research use of LLMs, and this workshop will equip you with the knowledge and tools you need to take advantage of LLM capabilities in your research.<!--excerpt-->  

We will explore a variety of use cases, from basic “chat” interactions to more advanced applications, including information retrieval and summarization and high-throughput automation. Along the way, we will learn about how LLMs and related technologies actually work, which will help you make well-informed decisions about how to best use them for your research.  

Ultimately, this workshop will put you in the driver's seat: you will be able to decide which models are most appropriate and how to use them, all while ensuring that you remain in full control of your data and results and in compliance with research security requirements.
