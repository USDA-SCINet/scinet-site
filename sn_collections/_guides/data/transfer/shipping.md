Large data transfers will be facilitated by the VRSC and involves users shipping external drives (not thumb drives) with their data on it to the VRSC in Ames, Iowa.  The VRSC will then upload the data directly and put it in a project directory specified by the user.  <!--excerpt-->

You can send external drives containing data to the VRSC if you have very large amounts of data (typically greater than 50 GB) to transfer to Ceres or if the network speed at your location is slow. Please follow these instructions:

1. Submit an email request to the VRSC [scinet_vrsc@usda.gov](mailto:scinet_vrsc@usda.gov?subject=large%20data%20transfer%20request) for a data transfer with the following information:  
   * Amount of data.
   * Target project directory.
   * Type of filesystem the data are coming from (Windows, Mac, or Linux).    

   If you don't already have a project directory, please request one first: [Request Project Storage](/support/request#project-request).  

2. Copy the data onto a SATA hard drive or solid-state drive (SSD)  
   * You will be responsible for purchasing your own drive(s).
   * Any type of external drive (not a USB drive) is fine, but SSDs will be more tolerant of the postal system.
   * Drives must be formatted as EXT4, NTFS, HFS, XFS, or FAT.  

3. Ship the external drive to the following address and email the tracking information to scinet_vrsc@usda.gov. Include a print out of your email containing the data transfer request to VRSC in your package. Send to:  
   * Nathan Humeston  
      74 Durham  
      613 Morrill Rd  
      Ames, IA 50011-2100  

4. Once we receive the data, we will copy it over to the appropriate project directory and notify you once it is complete.  

5. Please include a prepaid return shipping label so that we can send the drive(s) back to you after the data transfer is complete. Otherwise, the drive(s) will not be returned.
