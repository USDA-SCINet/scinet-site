# excerpt: 'This page describes recommended procedures for managing data on SCINet HPC and storage infrastructure.  The key concept is to use “co-located storage” (that is, storage that is local to a given HPC cluster) as needed for active computational work. Co-located storage is not backed up and should not be relied on for long-term storage purposes.  For long-term and permanent storage, use Juno instead.'

## Definitions
* **Juno:** Large, multi-petabyte ARS storage device at the National Agricultural Library in Beltsville,Maryland, accessed by users; periodically backed up to tape device.  Includes periodic file system snapshots that allow users to recover accidentally deleted files.
* **Tape backup:** Off-site backup of Juno, located at Mississippi State University and accessible by VRSC staff for disaster recovery following major system data loss.
* **Co-located storage:** Storage on either of the HPC clusters, local to computing resources. This storage is for storing code, data, and intermediate results that support on-going computational work. This storage is not backed up. Two storage locations are available on each HPC cluster, `/project` and `/90daydata`. Space in `/project` has a SCINet project-specific quota, while `/90daydata` does not have a quota and is best suited for intermediate results.

## Standards of Practice

![Figure 1]({{ images_path }}/data_management_sop-fig_1.png)
*Figure 1. Recommended procedures for managing data on SCINet HPC infrastructure using Globus.*

1. Move data to Juno
1. Copy data to target HPC (Ceres or Atlas)
1. Run compute tasks
1. Copy Results to Juno
1. Copy results to local machine, if desired

Given the space and access limitations of a home directory, large amounts of data or data that will be used collaboratively should be transferred to a project directory. See the User Guide section on [SCINet Storage](/guides/storage) for more information on home and project directory quotas.  


If you have issues with or questions about transferring data, please contact the VRSC at scinet_vrsc@USDA.GOV.
