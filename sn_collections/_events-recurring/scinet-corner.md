The SCINet Corner is a recurring virtual gathering to provide a space for people to meet and discuss SCINet-related items. The main idea is that SCINet users with similar interests can get help from each other. This virtual meeting will provide space for, and facilitate, these interactions on the first or second Thursday of the month.<!--excerpt-->
